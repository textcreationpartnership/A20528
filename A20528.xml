            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> in that most excellent <hi>Sermon</hi> of his upon the <hi>Mount,</hi> having taught and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many excellent things unto those Multitudes which then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him: at length knowing how usefull a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:25845:4"/> thing fervent and frequent prayer is for our safe and comfortable passage through this world to our heavenly home: commeth to informe them of divers things touching this so spirituall and heavenly Dutie. Having therefore in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Chapter given divers instructions touching <hi>Almes:</hi> in the next place, he comes to Prayer.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Giving generall directions touching it.</hi>
               </item>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>In generall he sheweth them, 1. <hi>what they should shunne and avoid, [Hypocrisie</hi>] in divers instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: <hi>Praying, standing in the streetes and Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, to be seene of men:</hi> and then, to <hi>shunne vaine repetitions.</hi> 2. Like unto a good Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an or Surgeon, he not onely sheweth the disease what it is; with the danger thereof: <hi>Verely I say unto you they have their reward:</hi> But also he <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth them the remedie;</hi> quite contrary to the disease: 1. <hi>To enter into their Closet: 2. To shut the doore, in secret. 3. To flie all likenesse unto these Hypocrites:</hi> (which indeed is a sure reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to shunne the first occasions of evill) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he addes a strong moving reason: <hi>For your Father knoweth what things yee have need of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you aske him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when our Saviour had thus made way, in preparing them for this so heavenly, spirituall and necessary a dutie: he in the next place tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth them the right forme and ground of true Prayer; answering unto all our necessities for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:25845:4"/> soule and for body, and that in a substantiall briefe manner. <hi>ver. 9. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>After this manner therefore pray yee: Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which art in heaven: Hallowed be thy Name, &amp;c.</hi> wherein we haue set downe;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A preface to the Prayer: <hi>After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner therefore pray yee: Our Father, &amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The forme of Prayer it selfe, in 6. peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</item>
               <item>3. The conclusion of the Prayer, shewing strong reasons for granting of these: <hi>For thine is the Kingdome, the Power, and the Glorie, &amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>First, In <hi>the Preface;</hi> we haue 1. <hi>A discoverie of our Saviours intention: viz.</hi> to set downe the ground and foundation of Prayer, <hi>After this manner therefore pray yee. 2. A direction how to begin aright.</hi> 1. Not to goe unto Saints or Angels, but unto our heavenly Father: 2. Not to be full of selfe-loue as to goe alone, but to take in others with our selues.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In <hi>the forme of Prayer</hi> it selfe, we are prescribed to aske. 1. In the three first peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>such things as concerne the glory of God:</hi> 2. In the three last, <hi>such things as concerne our good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, In <hi>the Conclusion:</hi> we haue <hi>the reasons enforced for speeding of these Petitions,</hi> very strong ones: because, <hi>all Dominion, Power, and Glorie is his for ever.</hi> All which is knit up with the assurance of Faiths certaintie of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:25845:5"/> speeding well (having thus prayed) in the word, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But more particularly in the <hi>Preface</hi> we haue set <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Summe. </seg>
               </label> downe, <hi>a most absolute preparation unto faithfull Prayer and Thankesgiving,</hi> wherein our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> sheweth, (if we would aright call upon the name of the <hi>Lord,</hi> so as we and our petitions may be accepted of him, and blessed by him) first, <hi>how we must stand affected towards men,</hi> in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this word [<hi>Our</hi>] which giveth us to understand that when we put up our supplications unto the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>God;</hi> we must <hi>not onely intreat him, to bestow good things upon us, but also speake a good word for the rest of his elect,</hi> that he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to be gracious unto them, even as unto our selues.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>how we must be perswaded of God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> viz:</hi> first, <hi>that hee is our Father,</hi> that is, such a <hi>God</hi> as pittieth us, and hath a tender regard of us, who is readie and willing to helpe us in our distresses, relieue us in all our miseries, and every way els, able to shew forth the bowels of a <hi>Father</hi> towards us: whereof, untill wee be in some measure assured; wee may well utter the words of prayer, but we can never bring a true faithfull prayer indeed before the <hi>Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And where it is said in the next words, that <hi>God is in Heaven,</hi> the meaning thereof is not, that <hi>God</hi> is shut up in that one place, more then in any other: for as <hi>Ieremie</hi> witnesseth, <hi>Hee filles heaven and earth with his presence,</hi> the whole<note place="margin">Ier. 23. 24.</note> world cannot containe him, but he containes it.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:25845:5"/>
               <hi>For in him we liue, and moue, and haue our being.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 17. 28.</note> Therefore when he is called, <hi>Our Father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven,</hi> implieth.</note> it is as much in effect as if he had beene ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>Our heavenly Father,</hi> (as else where he is) <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 32. that is, such an one, as is infinite in <hi>Power, Wisedome, Mercie,</hi> and of <hi>All-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie</hi> in every respect to doe us good, so that both of these, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is a <hi>Father,</hi> and an <hi>heavenly Father,</hi> are very necessary to be known and beleeved: For, <hi>if we be not perswaded that he is our Father, we shall not dare with boldnesse to approach unto him: and if we beleeue not that he is an heavenly Father, we shall thinke it bootelesse to depend upon him, and to expect blessings from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>After this manner therefore pray yee. Our Father, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> here setting down a most absolute and perfect platforme of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, according to which patterne, the supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all <hi>Gods</hi> servants are to be formed and framed, doth strictly enjoyne us to come unto our heavenly <hi>Father,</hi> and to none other but to him alone, whence we learne;<note place="margin">

               <hi>That none is to be prayed unto but God alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For howsoever we be not precisely bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">That all pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er must haue warrant and ground from the Lords Prayer.</note> the words of this prayer, yet we are tyed to obserue the substance of it: because no petition or thankesgiving can be allowable or accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unlesse it haue ground and warrant from the

               <hi>Lords</hi> prayer; And therfore in as much as there is no one word contained therein, that may giue the least shew of allowance, to put up our petitions unto any beside the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe. it hence evidently appeareth, that this service is to be consecrated and offered unto him alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that high honor which alone hee himselfe challengeth, saying, <hi>Call upon mee in the day of</hi>

The Sonne of <hi>God</hi> himselfe, who is best acquainted with his Fathers will saith, (ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it against the Devill,) <hi>Thou shalt worship</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 4. 10.</note>
               <hi>the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then Prayer be a part of <hi>Gods</hi> worshippe, (which none will deny) it must necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it is to be appropriated unto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
            <p>First, because (as <hi>Salomon</hi> testifieth in his<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because God onely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart.</note> prayer)<note place="margin">2 Chron. 6. 30.</note>
               <hi>The Lord onely knoweth the hearts of the children of men:</hi> whether they pray faithfully, or hypocritically, whether they come for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, with bare words of prayer, to serue their owne turnes: or of conscience, with sighes and groanes to magnifie <hi>Gods</hi> name, in asking that which may tend to his glory. If wee were to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:25845:6"/> make requests unto men or Angels, that cannot search into our thoughts and affections, a false hypocrite might speed as well as a true hearted Christian: <hi>Iudas</hi> might finde as good successe as <hi>Peter,</hi> nay many times farre better: for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them present their suites with a more glorious flourish of words, and those uttered in a more vehement and earnest manner in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, than sundry or almost any of <hi>Gods</hi> deare children can attaine unto. Which stands with good reason: for the Hypocrite lookes onely to the outside, even to the forme and order of his words and sentences, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may please others, or himselfe: whereas a Christian hath a principall respect unto the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and lookes chiefly upon his soule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; that he may draw his heart into <hi>Gods</hi> presence, and keep it there when it is there, from the beginning to the end of that holy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: striving withall for faith, reverence, and willingnesse to submit himselfe to <hi>Gods</hi> pleasure concerning the things hee asketh, and for the time of obtaining them, and the like: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward strife being that which <hi>God</hi> doth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally looke after, maketh a faithfull man to be in a sort regardlesse of that which carnall men doe most respect. Whence it would come to passe, that if any but the <hi>Lord</hi> had the hearing of their prayers, false hearted dissemblers should carrie away the reward from sound hearted Christians: But seeing that is his office, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects not the words of the lips, but the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:25845:7"/> of the heart, they shall speede best that are best. For <hi>He giveth unto every one, as hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 6. 30.</note>
               <hi>his heart.</hi> This then is the first reason, why <hi>God</hi> onely is to be invocated of us.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. In that prayer must be made to one of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A second is; <hi>That Prayer must be made to such a one, as is of absolute power, and sufficiency to heare and helpe all men, in all places, at all times, and in all needes:</hi> (for otherwise with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence or comfort can we become petitioners unto him,) now it is sure that no Saint, Angell, or any other Creature in heaven or earth is able to doe, (for they are all of a circumscribed nature, and of a finite power) onely the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie</hi> and <hi>All-sufficient Lord</hi> of heaven and earth can performe this, whose essence filleth<note place="margin">Ier. 23.</note> all the whole world, whose power is sufficient<note place="margin">Psal. 115.</note> to doe whatsoever he will, whose hand none can resist, and whose goodnesse never faileth<note place="margin">Dan. 4. Psal. 9.</note> those that seeke unto him. Whence it may firmely be concluded, that in our prayers wee must haue recourse unto him, and none other.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, because there is not in the whole<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Because the Scriptures giue no such precepts.</note> Scripture any Commandement or example of any one godly man or woman, that may giue us warrant to use the invocation of any, but of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>God alone:</hi> neither is there any promise of good successe if we should use it. And therefore such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> prayers of ours could not be faithfull prayers, as wanting a ground from the word, but sinfull<note place="margin">Rom 1. <hi>vlt.</hi>
               </note> and consequently abhominable before the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>Lord.</hi> Nay, we are so farre from having any example, or promise, or Commandement for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:25845:7"/> it, that we in this place haue a direct Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to the contrary. <hi>When yee pray</hi> (sayth our <hi>Saviour) pray thus, Our Father &amp;c.</hi> For thereby is implyed, that we must keepe our selues within the bounds of this prayer, which tyeth us to make our requests knowne unto <hi>God</hi> alone, so that hee that goes beyond the limits that <hi>Christ</hi> doth prescribe here, goes beyond a prayer of faith, and so makes a prayer of sinne, which the <hi>Lord</hi> cannot choose but hate and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre. Which serues.</p>
            <p>First, for <hi>the confutation and overthrow of that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse  </seg>1</label> sacrilegious doctrine of Poperie,</hi> that teacheth men to pray unto the <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which prayers can yeelde them no more comfort, then this prescript forme here set downe by our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> will yeeld them warrant for that which they doe.</p>
            <p>But they object, <hi>that they acknowledge their <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> prayers must be presented to God alone, but they may use the Saints and Angels as Mediators be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this is but meere dissembling and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>1</label> of their sinne, for (to say nothing of that point) that <hi>there is but one Mediator betweene God and man, even the man Christ Iesus,</hi> who by<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.</note> the incense of righteousnesse perfumeth the prayers of the Saints, that they may be pleasing<note place="margin">Revel. 8.</note> in the nostrels of the <hi>Lord</hi> of hoasts, though in themselues they savor strongly of the flesh: they doe giue them that divine worship, which is due unto <hi>God</hi> alone: which that we may the more
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:25845:8"/> cleerely discerne, let us hearken what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith. <hi>How shall they call on him, in whom they</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14.</note>
               <hi>haue not beleeved, &amp;c.</hi> If then they professe that they invocate Saints and Angels, they must likewise graunt they beleeue in them, which, what is it, but to giue unto them divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?</p>
            <p>Againe, when they pray unto them, they in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> effect acknowledge thus much, that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to heare them, and to relieue them alwayes, every where, and in every one of their needes: And what is this, but to giue unto them divine worship?</p>
            <p>Lastly, doe they not attribute that unto <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and to the rest of the Saints and Angels, which is the peculiar prerogatiue of <hi>God</hi> himselfe, namely, to be able to enter into mens hearts, and to discerne of their affections when they are praying unto them? What is this but to ascribe unto them divine honour, and to set them as it were in <hi>Gods</hi> Chaire of estate? Therefore be they never so full of damnable hipocrisie and cunning, to colour over this their fowle sin, with goodly and glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; It is sufficiently knowne unto <hi>God,</hi> and unto all godly men, that they commit grosse Idolatrie in that worship which they performe, for which they are esteemed Idolaters, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious persons, that robbe the <hi>Lord</hi> of his due honor, and shall receiue at the hands of <hi>God</hi> justice, a proportionable measure of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to their sinne.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:25845:8"/>
            <p>Secondly, It is for <hi>Instruction,</hi> sith <hi>God</hi> will <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>2</label> haue the hearing of all suites, immediately in his owne person, and sets none as substitutes under him in that office, this should teach us to <hi>be in league with him, and to cast off all manner of corruptions, that will bring us out of favour with him,</hi> for <hi>he is a God of pure eyes that cannot endure iniquitie,</hi> intertained and maintained, for if we regard wickednesse in our hearts, he will not<note place="margin">Psal. 66. 18.</note> heare us. Whence it comes to passe, that unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving <hi>Papists,</hi> and other sinfull persons, haue so little heart and courage to goe unto the <hi>Lord</hi> in his owne person, because their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences testifie against them, that they haue beene and are, and still purpose to bee notable Rebels against his Majestie.</p>
            <p>Let Christians therefore before they pray,<note place="margin">A helpe to prayer.</note> throughly consider with themselues, that they are to enter into his presence that is a <hi>God</hi> of perfect holinesse, and absolute puritie, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that unlesse they can haue free and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table accesse unto the throne of Grace, they neither haue title unto, nor can possibly haue the comfortable use of any blessing spirituall or corporall. And this they shall finde to be an excellent meanes to awe and terrifie them from offending him, on whom all their happinesse and prosperitie doth depend.</p>
            <p>If all the Subjects in the Land, were bound <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
               </label> in all matters of weight, to preferre their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall suites unto the Kings Majestie himselfe, that so he might giue sentence in his owne royall
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:25845:9"/> person, either for them, or against them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their demerites; would it not make them circumspect in their carriage and course of life, that it might be altogether such as should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse their loyaltie and due subjection unto their Soveraigne? So stands the case with all Christians, the great King of heaven, who is their <hi>Lord</hi> and Governour, will haue the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of all our causes himselfe, and will trust no deputie under him, that might be bribed, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, or feared, or in any sort corrupted, and his eye is fixed not onely upon their outward behaviour, (which is as much as earthly Kings can looke into) but also upon their inward man, he being the searcher and tryer of the heart and of the raines: which should cause us with all due care and circumspection to looke unto our hearts, and to our wayes, that he may espie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therein, which will provoke the eyes of his glory, and breake off our peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him. If they of <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 12.</note> thought it a point of good policie (as indeed it was) to come with one accord, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade <hi>Blastus, Herods</hi> Chamberlaine, by this <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
               </label> meanes to desire peace, when <hi>Herod</hi> intended to make warre against them, because their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey was nourished by the Kings Land. How much more should we account it Christian wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to prevent warres that might arise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>God</hi> of heaven and us? Especially, considering, that not onely the maintenance of our Countrey and estate, but the welfare of our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:25845:9"/> bodies and soules, and all the happinesse and comforts that we enjoy here, yea our salvation it selfe, and that felicitie which we expect here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, doth depend upon, and proceed from his meere bountie and free liberalitie.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this <hi>serveth for the comfort of all Gods <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>3</label> servants,</hi> that they are to put up their suites and requests unto the <hi>Lord</hi> onely and immediately, without the intercession of any Creature, and need not become Petitioners unto any other, either Saints or Angels, of whose continuall presence and readinesse, and abilitie to helpe and succour them all, wheresoever, and in what extremitie soever they shall be, they must needs be utterly uncertaine, and so haue their afflicted soules much turmoiled and perplexed within them: This (I say) is a marvellous great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto them, that they may haue free accesse (without any further adoe) unto the throne of his mercy, <hi>who is neere unto all them that call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

               <hi>and commandeth us to call upon him in time of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,</hi> with a certaine and undoubted promise, <hi>that he will deliver us, that so we may glorifie him,</hi> and will not impart this honor unto any other, but reserue it to himselfe as a speciall preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue royall (as it were) to be sued unto alone, of all such as professe themselues to bee servants and subjects unto his Majestie.</p>
            <p>Certainely, in as much as wee haue such a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:25845:10"/> worthy priviledge as this is, that we may come unto the Kings own person and presence, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we haue occasion, our sinne must needes be very great and grievous if we choose rather to haue recourse unto his Iustices, Constables, or under-officers whomsoever, (who neither will nor can undertake to heare us,) than unto his owne Majestie, leaving the fountaine of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waters, and making to our selues broken<note place="margin">Ieremie.</note> cisternes that will hold no water.</p>

               <p>THIS word [<hi>Our</hi>] implyeth what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection wee must beare towards men; namely, that when we bring our sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of prayer and prayse before the <hi>Lord,</hi> wee should be so farre in loue and charitie with men, that we should wish them as well as our selues, and pray and prayse <hi>God</hi> for them, as well as for our selues: So that hence we learne;</p>

                  <hi>That when we are to call upon the name of the Lord, we must so deale for our selues and our owne <label type="milestone">

What then though we be dull and heavie-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, so that we cannot powre out our soules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Lord</hi> as we ought to doe?

If our consciences witnesse thus much for us; let us not be dismayed, as if we should be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destitute of good things, because we cannot aske them in that manner as wee would: for doubtlesse, at that very time when wee feele greatest inabilitie unto this holy exercise, there are many thousand Christians in the world, on their knees offering up strong cryes unto <hi>God,</hi> which we haue as good interest in, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
               <p>The consideration whereof, should sustaine us, and hold our hearts in hope and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of favour from <hi>God,</hi> when we find our selues most unapt and unfit for this spirituall worke of prayer. When <hi>Peter</hi> was fast bound in prison,<note place="margin">Acts 12. 5, 6, 7</note>

               <p>First for <hi>God,</hi> he is in himselfe a just Iudge, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> such an one as can indure no iniquitie, nor beare<note place="margin">We are mise<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable without this assurance</note> with the least blemish and imperfection, unlesse satisfaction bee made unto his Iustice for the same.

               </p>
               <p>Now as the necessitie of the assurance of <hi>Gods</hi> favour appeareth by this, that we are very mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> without it, so doth it also by this, that we<note place="margin">We are bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed if we haue it.</note> are exceeding happie when we haue the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it: according to that of the <hi>Psalmist, Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>

Further, he hath the <hi>mercie</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> set a-worke for the pardoning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of his daily offences, and the plentifull supply of all needfull comforts, and (not to instance in all the particular Attributes of the <hi>Lord</hi>) hee hath him to be an <hi>All-sufficient God</hi> unto him, for the accomplishing and perfecting of his happinesse.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hee hath right to all the merits of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

                  <note place="margin">Then one hath peace with all the Creatures.</note> and that is, <hi>That hee hath peace with all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> as it is promised in <hi>Hoseah,</hi> when the <hi>Lord</hi> marrieth the people unto himselfe, then he <hi>will make a Covenant for them with the wild beastes;</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, whosoever hath gotten this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that he is within the Covenant of Grace, and is partaker thereof, he hath freedome from all hurtfull crosses, <hi>Hee shall no more beare the</hi>

All which reasons laid together, should bee as so many forcible arguments to convince us of the point in hand: that it is a thing absolutely needfull in our prayers, and supplications to be in some good measure assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that <hi>God</hi> is our Father.</p>
               <p>Which being so, maketh first of all for the <label type="milestone">

And here let us note (by the way) what
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:25845:16"/> small cause the <hi>Papists</hi> haue to boast of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their prayers: for they professe that they are not sure of that which is here required, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is their Father, without which (as we haue heard) every prayer that we make is a meanes to provoke the <hi>Lord</hi> to plague us, rather then any way to procure his blessings upon us, and therefore they can haue small comfort in the petitions which they haue &amp; doe put up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; nay, looke how many prayers they make, so many sinnes they commit, in that they take his holy name in vaine, all their crying is but as the howling of dogges, and contenteth<note place="margin">Hosea 7. 14.</note> the <hi>Lords</hi> eares no more than that doth ours.</p>
               <p>Let us in this case marke what the <hi>Author</hi> to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> saith, <hi>Hee that commeth to God must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve</hi>

                  <hi>God,</hi> and will shew himselfe to be his <hi>God,</hi> by recompencing him according to his faithfulnes in seeking of him.

In which regard it is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:25845:17"/> that we beleeue that he is a rewarder of such as are suitors unto him, and consequently that he is our Father, that wee are in favour with him, and hee bound by Covenant unto us.</p>
               <p>Therefore (in the second place) <hi>This should <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>2</label> cause us to use our best endevours to get this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance firmely grounded in our hearts, viz.</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is our Father, and that we are his childen: which that we may attaine unto, let us labour to haue in us these notes thereof, which follow.</p>
               <p>It is out of question, that none is the child of<note place="margin">Markes of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</note>
                  <hi>God</hi> by nature, but every one the child of wrath; And therefore whosoever would deriue his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree from <hi>God,</hi> must be able to shew that he hath beene <hi>begotten againe by the word of truth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iames 1. 18.</note> for except a man be regenerated, he hath no<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 3.</note> place in the kingdome of heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no portion in <hi>God</hi> himselfe. Let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine then whether the word hath at any time wrought effectually upon our soules or not, which wee may discerne by sundry effects (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest) by these that follow.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>If it hath enlightned our mindes and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> us an understanding heart, and a particular</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A distinct knowledge and inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things.</note>
                  <hi>distinct and directing knowledge concerning hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly matters.</hi> For this is a part of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant expressed in <hi>Ieremie</hi> (sayth the <hi>Lord) This is the Covenant that I will make with the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ierem. 31. 33 34.</note>
                  <hi>house of</hi> Israel, <hi>After these dayes (sayth the Lord) I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:25845:17"/> shall be my people: And they shall all know me from the least of them to the greatest of them.</hi> Not that all should haue the same measure of knowledge, but every one so much as should bee sufficient for his direction unto everlasting life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>If it hath wrought in us an holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> against our selues in regard of those sins</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our selues.</note>
                  <hi>which haue been formerly committed, and are now pardoned.</hi> This marke the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> sets downe, where speaking of those that were wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from all their filthinesse, and enriched with the saving graces of <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> he sayth, <hi>Then</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 31.</note>
                  <hi>shall yee remember your owne wicked wayes, and your deeds that were not good, and shall judge your selues worthy to haue beene destroyed, for your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and for your abominations.</hi> Before their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, <hi>Gods</hi> servants are readie to fall out with others, and to imagine that all is well with themselues: but after their conversion, their greatest quarrell is against their owne soules. And howsoever they know and beleeue that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath freely and fully forgiven them, yet will not they forgiue themselues for their evill thoughts, words, and workes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Wee must examine whether the word <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> hath brought us unto constant and generall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">When the word hath wrought us to universall obedience. Ezek. 36. 27.</note> for, that effect it produceth in all such as are indeed begotten againe thereby: according to that which is further promised in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. <hi>I will cause you to walke in my statutes, and you shall keepe my Iudgements, and doe them.</hi> If once we be <hi>Gods</hi> Schollers, he will certainely
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:25845:18"/> teach us this lesson, <hi>viz.</hi> not onely to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what his will is, but to practise it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. Other Schoole masters, though they <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                  </label> be never so skilfull and industrious, yet they may meete with such untowardly and untracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Schollers, that they can doe them little good, either for learning or for manners. But the <hi>Lord is such a teacher, that he never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes</hi>
                  <note place="margin">That God is the best Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</note>
                  <hi>to instruct any, but hee both informeth his judgement, and reformeth his practise:</hi> so that such shall not need to say, this is my nature, and I cannot amend such and such faults, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme these and these duties: But when <hi>God</hi> beginneth to teach them by his spirit, they may confidently tell their owne hearts, that through <hi>Gods</hi> grace they shall be inabled to doe both the one and the other, in some good and competent measure.</p>
               <p>The last note is, <hi>If it haue stirred up in our hearts an unfained loue towards Gods people, even because</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. A loue to the Saints, as Saints. Psal. 15. Psal. 16. 3.</note>
                  <hi>they are his people,</hi> so that we honour those that feare the <hi>Lord, and delight in the Saints that are excellent,</hi> rejoycing to see <hi>Gods</hi> Image shining forth in any, even in such as haue beene no way beneficiall, but rather some way injurious unto us.</p>
               <p>These notes may giue us some light to discern whether the word hath regenerated us, yea or no: which will appeare wheresoever they are, though at some times more evidently then at some other: by these therefore let us try our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, in which case if we find them in our selues
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:25845:18"/> upon a due search made. Then;</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>here is matter of very great consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>3</label> for us,</hi> howsoever the waues of adversitie flow in upon us on every side, and we be tossed too and fro with sundry and sore temptations, yet so long as we can hold this, that <hi>God</hi> is our gracious Father, in and through <hi>Christ,</hi> we haue a sure refuge to flie unto, and a <hi>God All-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> to whom we may make knowne all our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses, and from whom we shall receiue reliefe according to our severall needes and necessities. <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Ziklag,</hi> was in a great strait, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft<note place="margin">1 Sam.</note> of his wife and children, goods and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and in danger to be stoned by the people, and thereupon was exceedingly cast downe, so that, <hi>hee wept till hee could weepe no more,</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the flesh had had about, and playd the first part, he recovered his spirits, and comforted himselfe in the <hi>Lord</hi> his <hi>God,</hi> knowing that though all other comforts were gone, yet <hi>God</hi> remained still, who was able to restore unto him<note place="margin">1 Sam.</note> his losse (as after it fell out) and to pacific the hearts of the people that were causlesly enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged against him. The like course should we take in all our extremities, namely, betake our selues to our <hi>heavenly Father,</hi> by faithfull and fervent prayer, and so long as wee may haue recourse unto the fresh spring of all sound joy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, never vexe our selues with unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thoughts and cares, so long as he takes not himselfe from us, let us never be dismayed, though we be cut short of other things, for <hi>God
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:25845:19"/> is our exceeding great reward.</hi> And they who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 1.</note> they be, that doe not so esteeme him, are utterly unworthy and unfit to receiue blessing from him.</p>
               <p>But this will more fully appeare in the next point, which ariseth from hence, that <hi>God</hi> is said to be <hi>a Father in heaven,</hi> that is (as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore interpreted) an <hi>heavenly Father,</hi> such a one as is of perfect sufficiencie to helpe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue every one that repaires unto him for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. Whence we may obserue; That,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They that will pray well and speed well, must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Observat.</hi> 4 That God is All-sufficient for the helpe of his.</note>
                  <hi>that God is an heavenly Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, perfectly able to supply all their wants and to comfort them in all their distresses. This perswasion was in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when he made his prayer for himselfe and the whole Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning thus, <hi>O Lord God of heaven, the great</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nehem. 1. 5.</note>
                  <hi>and terrible God, &amp;c.</hi> These were titles that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted him for his present purpose: for he was to perswade an heathen King to reedifie the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and to restore the true worship of <hi>God,</hi> that had beene a long time abolished, to perswade him to be a friend to <hi>Religion,</hi> that was an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie both unto <hi>God</hi> and to all goodnesse: and therefoer he termed the <hi>Lord, the God of heaven,</hi> that is, <hi>the heavenly God;</hi> and more particularly, <hi>the great and wonderfull God,</hi> that is such an one as worketh great and wonderfull things, and therefore able to effect that which he was now
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:25845:19"/> to intreat of him, <hi>viz.</hi> to make those that wer persecutors of his people to become friends unto them, and become furtherers of them in their good and holy enterprizes. And further,<note place="margin">Deut. 29. 21.</note> he presses this, that <hi>Hee was a God that keepeth Covenant and mercie,</hi> and therefore having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, <hi>that not withstanding they should trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 30. 4.</note>
                  <hi>and be therefore scattered abroad among the people, yet if they did turne vnto him, and keepe his Commandements, he would gather them from the uttermost parts of heaven, and bring them againe unto their owne Land.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> (I say) having promised them this, hee intreateth him to keepe Covenant with them, and to be as good as his word, and so carries it cleere before him, and obtaines his hearts desire. So likewise <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he had undertaken to shew <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadnezzar</hi> his dreame and the interpretation<note place="margin">Dan. 2. 17. 18</note> thereof, which was impossible for him or any man to doe by humane wit or skill, he goeth to his house, and intreateth his Companions, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naniah, Mishael,</hi> and <hi>Azariah,</hi> that they would joyne in prayer with him, <hi>to beseech the God of heaven for grace in this secret.</hi> Wherein the <hi>Lord</hi> heard them, and granted them their request. The like is attributed unto <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> where it is said, <hi>Our God is in heaven,</hi> not that he is more there then in any other place, but the meaning is expressed in the words immediately following (which are these) <hi>hee doth whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 115. 3.</note>
                  <hi>he will,</hi> that is, he is of such absolute <hi>power,</hi> so that no creature is able to resist him, in that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:25845:20"/> which it pleaseth him to doe, and as his power is, such is his wisedome: nothing is so secret but it is well knowne unto him, yea, <hi>hee understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 139. 2.</note>
                  <hi>our thoughts long before our selues:</hi> Hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <note place="margin">The wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full provident wisedome of God.</note> knowes the matter whence they will arise, hee is so infinitely wise, that he can tell when to giue and what to giue, and how to deale with every one of us, yea such is the unsearchablenesse of his wisedome, that <hi>he can draw light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> and make us great gainers by our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and follies, and most dangerous falls. And that which hath beene spoken of his power and wisedome, holdes as true of all other his Attributes: for he is infinitely <hi>just, mercifull, gracious,</hi> and in a word, an infinite <hi>God</hi> in every respect: for if we take away any part of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, we take away part of the Godhead it selfe.</p>
               <p>Now the reasons why we must be thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of him, before we can faithfully pray unto him, are these:</p>
               <p>First, <hi>because otherwise we cannot put confidence <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> in him,</hi> according to that of the <hi>Psalmist, They</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 9.</note>
                  <hi>that know thy name will trust in thee, for thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failest them that seeke thee.</hi> Whence it may evidently be gathered, that till such time as men know that the <hi>Lord</hi> is infinitely <hi>strong, mercifull</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 34.</note> and <hi>just &amp;c.</hi> (which is the name of <hi>God</hi>) they can never truely rest upon him, and till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie upon him, they cannot possibly in faith make their prayers unto him, and so consequently not obtaine any thing in mercie from him.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:25845:20"/>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Till they be firmely perswaded hereof, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> they cannot with reverence worship the Lord;</hi> as is cleere by that argument that the wiseman useth when he saith, <hi>Be not rash with thy mouth, nor let</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 1.</note>
                  <hi>thy heart be hastie to utter a thing before God.</hi> And why? <hi>For God is in the heavens,</hi> that is, of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite majestie, and greatnesse, and thou art on earth, that is, full of basenesse and vilenesse. <hi>Therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>let thy words be few,</hi> to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter no more then thou canst well justifie from the warrant of the Spirit of Grace and of prayer.</p>
               <p>This serveth for the reproofe of a great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>1</label> even in the best of <hi>Gods</hi> children, in that they doe not beleeue that the <hi>Lord</hi> is <hi>All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi> for if they did, why should they be faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted when they are in great straits and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. This corruption we may obserue in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> (the most holy and worthy man that then lived upon the face of the earth) who when the <hi>Lord</hi> promised to feed the <hi>Israelites</hi> with flesh,<note place="margin">Num. 11. 19. 20.</note> and that for a whole moneth, being in a barren wildernesse, not neere any market, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them being so great as it was, even <hi>six hundred thousand men, beside women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> made doubt how it could possibly be: but what saith <hi>God</hi> unto him? <hi>Is the Lords hand shortned</hi> (saith he) <hi>Thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to passe unto thee, or not.</hi> Indeed, if he had beene an earthly King, it had beene a matter impossible for him to effect; But seeing he was an heavenly King, it was all one for him
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:25845:21"/> to feed six hundred thousand, as six, yea, as one poore childe: to feed them in a wildernesse, as in a plentifull land: for a moneth together, as for one day. For howsoever with us one thing is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier, and another harder, yet with <hi>God</hi> all things are alike easie and possible.</p>
               <p>And the like frailtie did <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray<note place="margin">Num. 20. 10.</note> in another place. <hi>Heare now yee Rebells</hi> (saith <hi>Moses) shall we bring you water out of this Rocke?</hi> (why not) If <hi>God</hi> appoint it to be so, he can as easily bring it out of a rocke as out of a River: but hereby they so dishonoured <hi>God</hi> in the presence of the people, that he excluded them both from the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And yet is there not the same unbeliefe in many of the deare servants of <hi>God</hi> in these our dayes? yes surely, for if they haue great yeerly revenewes, and a good stocke lying by them, and plentie of all things about them, then they hope <hi>God</hi> will provide for them and others; but what if they be destitute of all these earthly things? doe they not then imagine, that it will goe hard with them and their children? what is this, but to make flesh our arme, and to with-draw our hearts from the living <hi>God,</hi> so to pull downe his heavie plagues upon us? Let us therefore be ashamed of our ignorance and infidelitie in this or any other respect, and hereafter cast our cares wholy upon him, who hath said, <hi>I will not leaue thee nor forsake thee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Is it so, that the <hi>Lord</hi> is a <hi>Father,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>2</label> and an <hi>heavenly Father,</hi> of perfect abilitie and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:25845:21"/> sufficiencie to maintaine, deliver, and saue his children? Then, <hi>let us raise up our hearts against all discouragements, and in matters of great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and difficultie, goe unto the great God for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:</hi> and when we meete with impossibilities, in regard of any wisedome or strength that is in our selues, or any mortall man, then let us ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten unto the <hi>Lord,</hi> with whom all things are possible. But withall, take heed that we come in faith, and then, <hi>as all things are possible unto</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 9 23.</note>
                  <hi>God,</hi> so shall they be also unto the beleever, as our Saviour witnesseth: <hi>Are our iniquities so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and so grievous,</hi> that we perswade our selues,<note place="margin">Divers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts against divers discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements.</note> if men had so provoked us, as we haue provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the <hi>Lord,</hi> we could never find in our hearts to be reconciled unto them?</p>
               <p>Let us not be dismaied the reat, but sue unto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> our <hi>heavenly Father</hi> for pardon: and then shall we finde that <hi>His thoughts are not our thoughts, nor his wayes as our wayes,</hi> but that his mercie is infinitely greater then our offences are or can be, and that he is readie to forgiue the greatest sinne as well as the smallest, and ten thousand sinnes, as well as one.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>are our temptations divers and strange <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and exceeding violent,</hi> so as we doe not know which way to turne our selues, nor how to be ridde of them? let us make knowne our case un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Almightie God,</hi> who hath promised, <hi>shortly to</hi>

                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:25845:22"/> And (not to instance in many particulars) but briefly to shut up this Use;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatsoever our wants or distresses bee, inward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> or outward, spirituall or corporall,</hi> let us make them knowne unto our heavenly Father, who is both willing and able to relieue and support us.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>wee see no meanes nor likelihoodes how it can <label type="milestone">

               <p>NOw it followeth that we consider of the <hi>Prayer it selfe,</hi> which consisteth of six severall Petitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The three first of them concerning chiefly the Glorie of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The three last, the benefit and comfort of his Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the meaning of the first Petition,<note place="margin">1. Petition.</note>
                  <hi>Hallowed be thy Name:</hi> we must understand that by the <hi>Name of God,</hi> is signified all those things<note place="margin">What is to be understood by the name of God.</note> whereby he is made knowne unto the sonnes of men, as namely, <hi>his properties, and Attributes, his wonderfull workes of creation, of redemption, and of preservation: as also his holy word and blessed Sacraments,</hi> which doe carry a goodly stampe and print of the nature of <hi>God,</hi> and doe liuely expresse and manifest what manner of one he is unto mankind, and unto all his creatures.</p>
               <p>As for the word <hi>Hallowed,</hi> We must know<note place="margin">Hallowing Gods name what it is.</note> that <hi>to hallow, is to set a-part a thing from the common use to some proper end,</hi> and therefore, to <hi>sanctifie</hi> and <hi>hallow</hi> the <hi>name of God,</hi> is <hi>to set it apart from all abuses to an holy and reverent use.</hi> So that when we pray <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> it is thus much in effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord let thy Attributes, thy workes, and thine Ordinances be so knowne, esteemed, and embraced,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:25845:23"/> both of mee and of all thine elect people, that thou maist haue all due honor and glory: and let all the plots and practices of the devill, and his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments tending to the contrary, bee utterly brought to nought, and made to serue for the greater magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of thy glorious Name.</hi>

               <p>In that this Petition is set in the fore-front of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> Hence we may learne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Gods honor and glorie ought to be most deare</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Observat.</hi> 5. Gods glory must be most precious in our eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all.</note>
                  <hi>and precious in our eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of all the things that we are to desire and craue at the <hi>Lords</hi> hands, this must be the first and the principall, that his Name may be sanctified by us and the rest of his servants. And for this end and purpose are all other things to bee asked, namely, that by the enjoyment of them we may be the better enabled to honor and glorifie the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>God</hi> in all things. And therefore is that argument used in the conclusion of this prayer, <hi>for thine is the kingdome, the power and the glory &amp;c.</hi> Which is, as if we should say in more words These and these things haue we requested of thee (O heavenly Father) and we beseech thee to grant them unto us, that so thou mayest haue more <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> from us.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:25845:24"/>
               <p>And, <hi>As this is the chiefe thing which wee are</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. This in all our obedience must bee the cheefest thing aymed at.</note>
                  <hi>to aske in our prayers, so it is the principall matter which we are to ayme at in our obedience,</hi> as it doth evidently appeare by this, that the foure first Commandements, which are backed with most forcible reasons, doe especially concerne <hi>Gods</hi> glorie, and require that homage and service from us, which maketh chiefly for his honor.<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 32.</note> And of this point had <hi>Moses</hi> well considered, when he had such great respect unto the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous name of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that he was content <hi>to be blotted out of Gods booke,</hi> that <hi>Gods</hi> people might be saved, and <hi>God</hi> himselfe by that meanes the more glorified.</p>
               <p>And in like manner was <hi>Paul</hi> affected, for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his brethren the <hi>Israelites</hi> to grow still more hard and obstinate, as the Gospell was more cleerely and powerfully preached unto them, and knowing withall, that the <hi>Lord</hi> might haue more glory by their salvation, being many in number, then by his alone; he professeth, that <hi>hee could wish himselfe</hi> (if it might haue stood<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 3.</note> with <hi>Gods</hi> good pleasure) <hi>to bee separated from Christ, that they might be joyned unto him,</hi> and to be accursed, that they might be blessed: which he did not so much in loue unto them, as in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of advancing the glory of <hi>God,</hi> in saving so many thousand soules.</p>
               <p>And there is good reason why his honor should be so regarded of us. For, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>Hee deserved no lesse at our hands, seeing</hi>
                  <note place="margin">God deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth glory from us.</note>
                  <hi>that he made us, preserueth us, and bestoweth upon

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Hee will fully recompence us if we</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He will fully reward all.</note>
                  <hi>seeke to magnifie him:</hi> for he hath said, <hi>Them that honor me, I will honor.</hi> If then we would be kept<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 30.</note> from everlasting shame and reproach, and haue the crowne of never-fading honor set upon our heads: the readiest way to attaine thereunto is, to desire and endevour aboue all things that the<note place="margin">The dangers of not prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Gods name before all.</note> Name of <hi>God</hi> may be glorified. For if we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preferre any thing before it, or equall any thing unto it, either we shall not obtaine it, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> not in mercie enjoy it, because indeed we make an Idoll of it: and besides that we shall be sure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to haue infamie and contempt powred upon us, as a just reward of our impietie. Which ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth;</p>
               <p>First, for reproofe of a common and yet a <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>1</label> great corruption that is in our wicked nature, which is, <hi>to be more affected in our prayers with the sence and feeling of our wants, then with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Gods glorie.</hi> If we be poore and needie we can be well content that <hi>God</hi> should be our Treasurer, to serue our turnes, and to supply <label type="milestone">

                  </label> desire these things, that wee may liue as our neighbours doe, and hold up our heads with the <label type="milestone">

                  </label> best of them, that we may take our pleasure and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:25845:25"/> delight, and lead a merrie and contented life? Is this to ayme at <hi>Gods</hi> glory in our petitions? Nay, this is to seeke our selues, and hence it<note place="margin">A cause of crosses, though well-beloved of God.</note> commeth to passe, that <hi>the more God loveth us, the more he crosseth us in our desires,</hi> because wee doe not therein intend the setting forth of his praise, but meerely the satisfying of our fleshly lusts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let us hence learne <hi>to try the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>2</label> of our hearts, by examining how wee are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards his Name:</hi> for if wee can grieue<note place="margin">A tryall of a right heart with God.</note> when it is dishonoured, and rejoyce when it is glorified, we may assure our selues that our hearts are right with the <hi>Lord.</hi> As for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of these, we haue an example thereof in <hi>Moses:</hi> for nothing did so wound and kill his<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 19.</note> soule, as when he saw Idolatrie committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people of <hi>God,</hi> whereby his glory was stained: hee was never so much grieved when the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were mutinous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and readie to reject his government, as when they were rebellious against the <hi>Lord,</hi> and cast off the yoake of obedience due unto him. And that was it that peirced the heart of <hi>Eliah</hi> also, <hi>I haue beene very jealous for the Lord</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The like may be said of good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who (when <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> railed on him and on the rest of the <hi>Iewes</hi>) was not much moved thereat:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:25845:25"/> But when he heard of his horrible blasphemies<note place="margin">Isa. 39. 3. 4.</note> against the Name of the <hi>Lord, Hee rents his clothes, and puts on sackcloth, and sent unto the Prophet Isajah,</hi> certifying him, <hi>how he had railed on the living God, and reproached him with words:</hi> earnestly intreating him to lift up his prayer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven, and he himselfe doth the like; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching</hi>

               <p>We haue the Prophet <hi>Davids</hi> example, who

               </p>
               <p>The first thing that we are to pray for, is <hi>sound <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <note place="margin">Sound knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> knowledge,</hi> without which it is impossible to sanctifie <hi>Gods</hi> Name. Therefore it is said in the <hi>Psalme, They that know thy Name will trust in</hi>

And the like may be said concerning <hi>Gods</hi> eternall <hi>Decree of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination:</hi> A great many not having their mindes informed with sound understanding doe fret, repine, and cavill against the <hi>Lords</hi> dealing in that behalfe, as if it could not stand with his justice to elect some, and to reject others, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point some unto eternall joy and happinesse, and other some unto everlasting woe and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. But the holy Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> being through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instructed in heavenly misteries, doth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly magnifie the <hi>Lord</hi> for the same, having that in high admiration, which hee could not bring within the compasse of his comprehension. <hi>Oh! the deepenesse of the riches both of the wisedome</hi>

                  <hi>and knowledge of God</hi> (saith he) <hi>how unsearchable are his judgements, and his wayes past finding out?</hi> Neither are ignorant persons any whit more fit to glorifie <hi>God,</hi> in making use of his word, then they are in taking benefit by his workes.

               <p>But when once wisedome enters into the soule and knowledge delighteth the heart, then are they fitted to sanctifie the name of the <hi>Lord</hi> in every respect, in his word, workes, judgements, mercies, both in themselues, and others, in this life, or in the life to come. Here then we are to pray, that wee our selues and all <hi>Gods</hi> people, may attaine unto sound understanding: and so farre as we labour for this, and stirre up others to doe the like, so farre men doe conscionably use this Petition, <hi>Hallowed be thy name;</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, though the words be never so frequent in our mouthes, we doe but dissemble, and doe not indeed from our hearts desire that <hi>Gods</hi> name may be sanctified. And therefore hee may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer every one of us that pray in that sort, thou hypocrite, doest thou intreate that my <hi>Name may bee hallowed,</hi> and yet never takest any course whereby it may be effected? What is this, but to take my name in vaine, and to abuse my holy presence? If thou wouldest haue thy requests to be accepted of me, labour for that in action,

               <p>Now further, as <hi>we are to pray for knowledge, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> so are we also to desire that it may be effectuall, and</hi>

Doe we know that <hi>God</hi> is true in the performance of all his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; then are we bound to sanctifie his name in our hearts by beleeving them, and by depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and waiting upon him for the fulfilling of them, whatsoever difficulties there bee, which may any way hinder the same.</p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Abraham</hi> glorifie <hi>God,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle witnesseth of him, <hi>Romans</hi> 4. there were
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:25845:29"/> two impossibilities, the one in nature concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Abraham</hi> and his wife, that he being <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most an hundred yeares old,</hi> should beget a sonne,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 17.</note> and she being ninetie yeares of age should beare a sonne. The other was concerning the <hi>Lord,</hi> who if he did not effect this, must needes shew himselfe to be untrue of his word, and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in keeping his promise, as for this latter, it was simply an impossibilitie, and therefore <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> concluded with himselfe, that <hi>God</hi> could not be a lyer, therefore whatsoever impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie there was in nature, yet he resolved that he would glorifie <hi>God,</hi> in beleeving that he would be as good as his word. <hi>Hee considered not his owne body</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>which was now</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 11.</note>
                  <hi>dead, neither the deadnesse of</hi> Sarahs <hi>wombe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he doubt of the promise of God through unbeleefe, but was strengthned in faith, and gaue glory to God, being fully assured that hee that had promised was also able to doe it.</hi> And that this is an honouring of <hi>Gods</hi> name, will hence evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare, that men doe account it a great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit unto them to be beleeved, and to bee estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men of their word: and doe thinke the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary a great disgrace. Are men so jealous of their names in that behalfe, and shall wee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the <hi>Lord</hi> is not much more jealous of his? Yes surely, he makes reckoning of those that giue him the glory of his truth, doe much magnifie him: and that they who do in thought, word, or deed detract therefrom, doe greatly dishonour him. Yet such is the sinfulnesse of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:25845:29"/> our wretched natures, that notwithstanding all the blessed promises that are made unto us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning spirituall things, and our eternall sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as also concerning the things of this life, and our outward preservation, yet we are readie to doubt still, and to make question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they shall be performed or not: What is this, but to imagine that the <hi>Lord</hi> is like us, much in words, and little in deedes?</p>

               <p>WEE heard out of the former petition<note place="margin">2.

Which are;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The comming of his Kingdome.</hi>

               <p>But for the better understanding of this peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wee must know that <hi>the kingdome of God</hi> is taken two wayes, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First generall, for <hi>his government over all the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How the kingdome of God is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</note>
                  <hi>whole world:</hi> In which sense it is said in the <hi>Psalme, The Lord raigneth, and is clothed with majestie, the Lord is clothed and girded with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Psal. 93. 1.</note> And in another <hi>Psalme; The Lord raigneth, let the people tremble.</hi> And againe, <hi>The Lord is a</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 99. 1.</note>
                  <hi>great God, and a great King aboue all Gods.</hi> From which places, it is evident that he ruleth, gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,<note place="margin">Psal. 95. 3.</note> and exerciseth his power over all the earth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:25845:34"/> and over all the creatures in the same. As for this <hi>Kingdome,</hi> we pray not for it in this place, for it hath beene, is, and ever shall be alike: so that to pray for the comming of this Kingdome, were not a prayer of faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It is taken for that more speciall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of God, which he exerciseth in the hearts and consciences of his people, by the scepter of his word, and the powerfull operation of his holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> through the which hee pulls us out of the kingdome of Sathan, (who is the Prince of<note place="margin">Ephe. 2. 2.</note> darkenesse, and ruleth in all the children of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience) and receiveth us unto himselfe, to be guided and governed according to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine statutes and heavenly lawes. For this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome we pray in this petition: which is indeed properly the Kingdome of <hi>Christ,</hi> because hee<note place="margin">Revel. 15. 3.</note> is the <hi>King of Saints,</hi> (as the Scripture termeth him) but it is here attributed to the <hi>Father,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 24.</note> he governeth by his <hi>Sonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In this Petition therefore, wee pray that all Gods</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What we pray for here.</note>
                  <hi>Elect may bee converted, that they may attaine to knowledge and conscience: And that such as haue this good worke of grace begun in them alreadie, may haue it daily increased, and continually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected more and more: and that at length, after they haue spent their dayes in the kingdome of Grace, they may come to the fruition of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Glorie.</hi> Which is also intimated in this Petition.</p>
               <p>Thus much briefly concerning the generall drift and meaning of the words.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:25845:35"/>
               <p>Now more particularly, concerning such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions as are therein contained for our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in these words.</p>

                  <hi>heartily to pray for the Kingdome of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every one that professeth himselfe to be a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto the King of heaven, must ardently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that Sathans kingdome may be demolished, and overthrowne, and that the <hi>Lord</hi> may beare sway in his soule, and the soules of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8. 9.</note> unto him. This did <hi>Paul</hi> desire for himselfe thinking <hi>all things but losse, and judging them no better then dung for the excellent knowledge sake of Christ Iesus, that he might be found in him, not having his owne righteousnesse, which was by the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, that hee might know him, and the vertue of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and the fellowship of his afflictions, and might be made conformable unto his death.</hi> No man knowes the excellencie of grace, but hee that hath it, which when any hath in some good measure, he is so ravished with the loue and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, that he preferres it before all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in the world. And so did <hi>Paul,</hi> as we see in this place, having once tasted how good the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:25845:35"/>
                  <hi>Lord</hi> was, hee could not bee satisfied with that measure of mortification, and vivification which he had received, though it were very large, but hee still longeth and laboureth for more, and striveth hard toward the marke, that he might attaine to an experimentall knowledg of the vertue of <hi>Christ</hi> his death, for the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his flesh and of his resurrection, for the quickning of his soule unto everie good worke.</p>
               <p>Neither doth he desire this for himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but for his brethren the <hi>Iewes,</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (as was before noted) himselfe to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly cast off (if it had beene possible) separated from <hi>Christ,</hi> so that they might bee converted and sanctified, and saved: and, <hi>for the increase of Grace where it was begunne,</hi> we may obserue throughout his Epistles, how earnest he is for the obtaining thereof. I will onely quote two places of many, for the manifestation of his zeale in this behalfe.</p>
               <p>One out of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> where he saith, <hi>For</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 3. 16. 17</note>
                  <hi>this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, that he would graunt you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that yee being rooted and grounded in loue, may bee able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the bredth, and length, and depth and height &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And againe, for the <hi>Philippians,</hi> he prayeth<note place="margin">Phil. 19.</note> that <hi>their loue might abound more and more in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:25845:36"/> knowledge, and in all judgement, that they might discerne things that differ, and that they might be pure and without offence untill the day of Christ, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we see it plainly proved, out of <hi>Paules</hi> example, that it is a dutie for us evermore to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that the graces of <hi>Gods</hi> spirit may bee wrought and continued and still increased both in our selues and others: which is all one with this petition, where <hi>Christ</hi> biddeth us to pray, <hi>Thy kingdome come:</hi> for wheresoever the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying gifts of the holy Ghost are, there doth <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> rule and raigne. <label type="milestone">

                  </label>
               </p>
               <p>But let us yet further consider of some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for the confirmation of this point, that it stands us upon to pray for the erecting of his kingdome in our hearts.</p>
               <p>First of all; This may be one forcible reason <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to induce us thereunto, that till such time as this holy government is established in our hearts, we can never sanctifie nor glorifie the name of <hi>God,</hi> as in the former petition we are taught to doe. For no unregenerate man, can in thought, word or deed, conceiue, utter, or performe any thing that may tend to the <hi>Lords</hi> honor, untill he be a subject and servant unto <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and untill he by his scepter haue beaten downe the sinnes<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 5.</note> of his soule, he is but a lumpe of flesh: <hi>Hee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voreth the things of the flesh, and is led by the wisedome of the flesh, which is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can bee:</hi> and being wholy in the flesh (as the Apostle speaketh) it
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:25845:36"/> is impossible that he should please <hi>God,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently impossible that hee should any way glorifie <hi>God.</hi> And therefore, as often as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth before the throne of Grace with that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, <hi>Hallowed bee thy Name;</hi> he prayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, as having no warrant to take that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition within his lippes, being utterly unfit for that great worke of hallowing the <hi>Lords</hi> most glorious Name. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>2</label>
               </p>
               <p>A second reason, to moue us to desire the comming of the Kingdome of Grace, <hi>may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the miserable estate that we are in before, and the happie condition that we are brought vnto after we haue Christ to beare rule in vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for our miserie before such time as we haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> taken up the sweet and pleasant yoake of <hi>Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">For our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer miserie</note> it is verie great: for we are in bondage unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and unto every vile and base lust, and so are<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 3.</note> subiect to the eternall curse and malediction of <hi>God,</hi> &amp; lyable to all manner of judgments both <hi>corporall</hi> and <hi>spirituall,</hi> both in this <hi>life</hi> and in that <hi>which is to come.</hi> This doth partly appeare<note place="margin">Acts 26. 18.</note> in that place of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where the <hi>Lord</hi> sheweth the use and end of <hi>Paules ministrie,</hi> for that he was sent unto the Gentiles, <hi>To open their eyes, that they might turne from darknesse to light, and from the power of Satan vnto God, that they might receiue forgiuenesse of their sinnes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among them which are sanctified by faith in Christ.</hi> In which words, is liuely described and set forth the estate of all those that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the precincts and limits of <hi>Christ</hi> his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:25845:37"/> to wit, that they are altogether blind in spirituall matters, the eyes of their mindes are quite shut up, so that they can see no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning heauen or hell, concerning holy duties to bee performed, or sinfull courses to bee eschewed, then one that is vtterlie voide of sight, is able to discerne of those obiects that lie directly before his eyes. There is nothing in their mindes but a confused heape of ignorance errours and false opinions, and consequently nothing in their hearts but (as it were) a Sea of ungodly lusts, and wretched affections: whence it commeth to passe, that living wholie in darknes, they are enthralled unto the diuell himselfe, who is the Prince of darknes, and (as this text speaketh) <hi>under the power of Satan</hi> that is, not onely subiect to be tempted, and assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by him (for that is incident to the most godly) but wholy given up to bee ruled, guided and ordered by him, and that in their <hi>thoughts words</hi> and <hi>workes.</hi> This is the naturall condition of all the Sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> to be vassals unto all manner of impietie and iniquitie, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently slaues unto him that ruleth in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of disobedience, so that they must be at his command and be subiect to his lawes, even <hi>the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eyes, and the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Iohn.</note>
                  <hi>Pride of life.</hi> And withall (which is the worst of all) they must stand to his reward, which is verie bad in this world, but farre worse in that which is to come: For they that haue giuen them selues to the service of the devill in their
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:25845:37"/> lifetime, shall afterwards be tormented with the<note place="margin">Math. 25.</note> devill and his Angels in hellish torments. and that for evermore: and therefore if it be ill ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving off such a master, as can requite us with no better wages, let us cast of his yoake with all speed, and pray as we are commanded, <hi>Thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But oh! This is it that addeth much unto the miserie of unregenerate persons, that the more sinfully they carrie themselues, the more they please themselues: and when they runne full manie in the broad way toward hell, they thinke themselues the happiest men that liue; and condemne them for foolish and mad peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that walke in the wayes of life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: and decline from such dangerous cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as they in their follie goe forward in, to their euerlasting ruine and perdition. Thus much breefely of the miserie that we are in, till such time as we be subjects of <hi>Christ</hi> his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> kingdome. Now in the next place, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,<note place="margin">Benefits by liuing under Christ his gouernment.</note>
                  <hi>of the benefits which we shall reape by liuing under that heauenly gouernment,</hi> and that in respect of our <hi>king, of his lawes and of his rewards, present</hi> and <hi>future, temporall and eternall</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for our <hi>King</hi> (in the first place) he is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> both able and willing to make<note place="margin">1. In respect of our King.</note> all his subiects perfectly happie in all respects: which that we may more fully and cleerly perceiue, let us take a briefe veiw of some places of scripture, which doe most liuely describe him unto us.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:25845:38"/>
               <p>And for this purpose, <hi>Psalme</hi> 93. is very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy our consideration, where it is said, <hi>The</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 93. 1.</note>
                  <hi>Lord raigneth, and is clothed with majestie.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings are adorn<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d with gorgeous and roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all apparell, as was <hi>Solomon,</hi> to make them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare more glorious unto the beholders, which argueth an imperfection in themselues, in that they are driven to seeke a kinde of excellencie out of themselues: but the King of Heaven needes no such matter: his owne Majestie serues insteed of royall robes, and therein doth he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely surpasse all the glory of earthly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narkes. Then further it is said in that <hi>Psalme, The Lord is clothed and girded with power:</hi> earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kings haue their guard about them, and doe protect their persons by men and munition; by sword and shield and the like, because in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are weake in themselues, and neede these externall helpes for their safeguard: As for the <hi>Lord,</hi> he cares not for any of these; his own power is sufficient both to saue himselfe and his subjects, and to overthrow his foes with all their malicious attempts. Againe, in that <hi>Psalme</hi> is shewed, that as <hi>God</hi> hath power, so he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise the same. <hi>The world is established by him, that it cannot be moved.</hi> Earthly Princes doe not alwayes use that power which they haue, for sometimes they are so idle that they will not, and at other times so crossed that they cannot, but the King of Kings doth alwayes put his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in practice, in the government of the world and of every thing therein. And among
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:25845:38"/> other things, herein doth his wonderfull po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer appeare, that he makes the whole earth to hang unmoveable even in the midst of the ayre, without any prop or stay at all.</p>
               <p>Thus we see in part out of that <hi>Psalme,</hi> what a glorious and mightie King the <hi>Lord</hi> is: but his excellencie will be yet more perspicuous, if we consider of some more of his Attributes, as we finde them set downe in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>First then to speake somewhat of his <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Of Gods Omniscience and knoledge</note>
                  <hi>and infinite knowledge,</hi> it is such, that he understands all things, and therefore knowes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of his subjects by name, which <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> himselfe, though the wisest King that ever was, could not doe. The <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> complaining of his peoples unbeliefe, <hi>Zion hath said, the Lord hath</hi>

                  <hi>walles are ever in my sight.</hi> This much was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry liuely signified in the time of the <hi>Leviticall Law,</hi> for then it was commanded that the high Priest (who was a type of <hi>Christ</hi>) should car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the <hi>names of the twelue Tribes of the children of</hi> Israel <hi>on both his shoulders:</hi> being graven on the <hi>Ephod,</hi> and on his heart, and on his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, so that he loues them dearely, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them mightily, and that at all times, for
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:25845:39"/> he is ever busied in the execution of his office: whence it must necessarily follow, that he takes speciall notice of all of them, and of every one of them: yea, not onely of their persons, but also of their wants: he sees all their distresses, and foresees all their perills.</p>
               <p>Touching their necessities, our <hi>Saviour</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth<note place="margin">That God sees the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of his children.

               <p>And concerning his <hi>foreseeing of perils,</hi> it is<note place="margin">Of Gods excellencie in forseeing of dangers.</note> evident in this, that knowing of the samine that should be in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> he sent <hi>Ioseph</hi> before hand into the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to provide<note place="margin">Psal. 105. 17.</note> for his Father <hi>Iacob</hi> and his familie. And indeed how can it be, but he must needs fore-see such things, since he doth fore-appoint the same? And herein also hee goeth beyond all worldly government: For they are not acquainted with the wants of all their subjects that are presently upon them, much lesse can they haue understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of dangers before they befall them, and least of all, prevent every imminent evill where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Subjects may be annoyed.</p>
               <p>Againe, as <hi>God</hi> in wisedome doth infinitely<note place="margin">Of Gods goodnes in his loue to his servants.</note> excell all earthly Potentates, so doth he also in <hi>goodnesse,</hi> there is never a subject nor servant of his, but he loues him with an unmeasurable and with an everlasting loue; as the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe protesteth unto his Church, saying, <hi>For a little</hi>

               <p>Againe, <hi>in regard of his Truth,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:25845:40"/> greatly to be magnified, for we may build upon<note place="margin">In regard of his truth.</note> his word: whatsoever he saith he will assuredly doe it, <hi>not one jot or title of his word shall perish,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 5.</note>
                  <hi>till all bee fulfilled.</hi> It is otherwise with earthly Rulers, they many times say and doe not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bause they are fickle and changeable, and mind one thing to day, and another to morrow: and because they oft-times say, that which they are utterly unable to performe, or they are cut off before they haue time to goe thorough with it.<note place="margin">Iames 1.</note> But with the King of Kings <hi>there is no variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> he is the same still, and changeth not: his<note place="margin">Psal. 115. 3.</note> power is as large as his will, and <hi>his kingdome is</hi>

                  <hi>from generation to generation,</hi> and therefore hee must needes be as good as his word.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, this King is just in all his wayes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> whereas <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> though otherwise<note place="margin">In regard of his justice.</note> good and godly Kings, dealt unjustly in divers things, as <hi>David</hi> in the matter of <hi>Vriah,</hi> and of <hi>Mephibosheth:</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> in laying too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1 King. 4. 7.</note> burthens upon the people, in so much that being wearie of them, they fell to mutinie and rebellion.

                  <note place="margin">Psal. 9. 4.</note>
                  <hi>and judgeth right,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaketh.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:25845:40"/> considers all his subjects wants and distresses, as pitties their case: as is able to helpe and saue them, and because he hath promised so to doe, cannot in his justice deny the performance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>If (I say) it bee a speciall priviledge, to liue under such a ones government, then may it strongly bee concluded hence, that his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ought earnestly to be desired, which is the point that we haue now in hand. And thus much concerning our King.</p>
               <p>In the next place, <hi>let us consider of his lawes,</hi>

Other Princes doe now and then make lawes and constitutions, to serue their owne turnes, though in the meane time those that are under their jurisdiction, pay for it, and finde themselues much oppressed and over-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened: but there is not the meanest Christian, that hath any cause at all to complaine.

               </p>

                  <hi>Ioy in the holy Ghost;</hi> That is, such joy as is<note place="margin">1 Peter 1. 8.</note>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:25845:41"/> wrought by <hi>Gods</hi> holy spirit, which is <hi>unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and glorious,</hi> whereof when men haue once tasted, they giue over their vaine and foolish sports, with their fleshly and mad delights, with such a detestation of them, that it makes them even sicke to thinke upon them.</p>
               <p>These are the priviledges of <hi>Christ</hi> his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the like graces whereof hee doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to every one of his Subjects; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by indeed they are made spirituall Kings, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where it is said, that <hi>Christ hath loved us,</hi> and (for the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting<note place="margin">Revel. 1 5. 6.</note> of his loue) <hi>hath washed us from our sinnes in his bloud,</hi> what followeth upon this? <hi>Hee hath made us Kings and Preists unto God, even the Father. &amp;c.</hi> No earthly King can thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre any of his Subjects, much lesse all of them.

Whosoever will let <hi>Christ</hi> raigne in his heart while he liues, shall undoubtedly raigne with him when hee dyes. And whosoever is a subject in the Kingdome of Grace, shall be a King everlastingly in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Glorie, where he shall haue more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and happinesse in one minute of an houre, then he had here in all his life time. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, (as in all other things) <hi>Gods</hi> rewards and promotions doe surpasse any earthly Kings; for theirs are momentarie and vanishing, but his durable and eternall. But of these we shall haue occasion to speake more fully in handling the next point.</p>
               <p>Now that we may draw to some <hi>vse</hi> of the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>1</label> point, is it so, that the comming of <hi>Christ</hi> his kingdome, is so desirable? Then first of all, here are those to bee reprooved, that in words pray, <hi>Thy kingdome come;</hi> But in truth, they wish it
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:25845:42"/> not from their hearts, as their practice doth evidently declare: for, they hate the scepter of this heauenly King, <hi>viz.</hi> his holy <hi>word,</hi> and the instructions that are given them by his servants, and if <hi>God</hi> would graunt the desire of their soules (as many times in his justice hee doth,) they would much rather liue where the scepter of the diuell rules, then where <hi>Christ</hi> swaies by <hi>the rod of his power,</hi> as the word is termed. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 110. 2. For if a man should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to many mens consciences, would they not choose rather to be in such families, and congregations, where there is swearing, and sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-breaking, and rioting, and swilling, dauncing, gaming, and such like, then where there is praying, preaching, catechising, and singing of Psalmes, and other the like holy and religious exercises: If it be so (as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny) what should they speake of their desiring of the comming of <hi>Christ</hi> his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? they doe but play the hypocrites in so doing, for they refuse the government of this heauenly King, and shew themselues to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed enemies unto him, whatsoever pretences they make to the contrary. This <hi>Iob</hi> prooveth euidently, to the faces of all hypocrites, of whom he avoucheth, that <hi>They say unto God, depart from us,</hi> not that any will be so blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, as in plaine termes to utter so much, but in effect they manifest that their desire is such, that they would willingly haue nothing to doe with <hi>God:</hi> and how doth he prooue
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:25845:43"/> this? by two arguments: one is this <hi>That they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> doe not desire the knowledge of his wayes,</hi> for they are utterly destitute of heauenly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, affecting their grosse ignorance more then sauing knowledge, which appeareth in that they will not take paines for it: nay, they will not entertaine it, when it is brought home unto them.</p>
               <p>An other argument is, that they imagine, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there comes no profit, nor benefit by serving such a master. <hi>Who is the Allmightie, that wee should serue him</hi> (say they) <hi>and what profit should we haue, if we should pray unto him?</hi> As if they should say, there is much a doe about seruing of <hi>God,</hi> and many faire promises are made to such as seeke unto him: but we cannot see that men speed so well by their hearing and praying and such like: others that take not such courses carry away the wealth and promotions of the world from them; And therefore I will neuer trouble my selfe with such matters, these are the thoughts and resolutions of carnall men: who hope to get more by the service of Sathan, and of their owne lusts then by the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the King of heauen. And therefore they wholy apply themselues to rooting and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the earth (like moles,) utterly reiecting the knowledg and practice of holy duties. Such were they of whom mention is made in the Parable that would not haue the king to raigne<note place="margin">Luk. 19. 14.</note> ouer them. And as they loue not the King, nor his lawes, so can they not away with his <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:25845:43"/> and <hi>subjects:</hi> but when they see them come from other places with their bibles, to be instructed in the lawes of their heavenly King, they maligne them, and snarle at them, and will not suffer them by their good will, to sit quiet at sermon by them.</p>
               <p>Neither doe they esteeme of those rewards, which are conferred upon Christians, but like prophane <hi>Esau,</hi> doe make more account of a<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 32.</note>
                  <hi>messe of pottage,</hi> then of the birth-right, of a few sinfull pleasures and base commodities, then of the <hi>righteousnesse of Christ, and of that peace of conscience, that passeth all understanding: with the joy of the holy Ghost, which is unspeakable and glorious,</hi> or of that happinesse, which is treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up for the Saints in the life to come.

                  <hi>must bee, that it would please the Lord to send forth labourers into his harvest, and to furnish all Congregations with learned, able, and faithfull Ministers.</hi> For they are the <hi>Lords</hi> Captaines to fight his battels, against the flesh, the world, and the devill: and to draw men from under Sathans tyrannie; to liue under the <hi>Prince of peace.</hi> This is cleere in the Prophesie of <hi>Isaiah,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Not such as are <hi>carnall,</hi> that is, weake and of little or no force against the Adversarie, but

                  <hi>spirituall weapons, taken out of the Lords owne Armorie,</hi> which are mightie and powerfull, where it pleaseth the <hi>Lord</hi> to worke by them, to overthrow all the strong holds, and fortresses that Sathan hath set up in mens soules, and to bring into subjection not onely the outward man, (which is as much as any earthly Prince can require) but the inward man also, framing and inclining the very secret thoughts and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of the heart, unto that whole obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which the <hi>Lord</hi> requireth. And yet further the same Apostle, writing to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 1.</note> them in mind, <hi>how they received the spirit by the hearing of faith,</hi> that is, of the doctrine of faith, which is so called, because (as hee saith<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14.</note> else where) by the <hi>preaching thereof we come to beleeue,</hi> and so to haue <hi>Christ</hi> his throne set up<note place="margin">Ephes. 3. 13.</note> within us, <hi>for hee dwelleth in our hearts by faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then the Ministrie of the word bee that<note place="margin">The effectuall power of the ministrie of the word is shewed.</note> which dispossesseth Sathan the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which maketh a riddance of all manner of sinnes and corruptions, and which is as it were a Chariot to convay the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> into mens hearts, which worketh in them faith, and all other graces necessarie to salvation, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them fit and readie for every holy dutie and service. These things considered, it must needes be concluded to be a speciall meanes to erect the kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> in the soules of his chosen, and therefore we are by this second <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi> directed to pray, that where there is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and powerfull preaching, the <hi>Lord</hi> would
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:25845:46"/> continue it, and giue his Servants grace and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to use their gifts aright, otherwise, they may doe more hurt then good.</p>
               <p>And withall, <hi>that he would vouchsafe, to blesse</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. We pray here that God would blesse all Schooles of learning.</note>
                  <hi>all Schooles of learning, that they may be Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of good and holy zealous teachers,</hi> that so where an holy Ministery is wanting, it may be supplyed. And <hi>light may shine to them that sit in darknes, and in the shadow of death.</hi> Thus the Apostle exhorteth the <hi>Thessalonians; Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Brethren pray for us</hi> (saith he) <hi>that the word</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Thes. 3. 1.</note>
                  <hi>of the Lord may haue free passage, and be glorified even as it is with you:</hi> Where he willeth them, to aske these two things, first that they might haue liberty in their ministrie, to preach the Gospell without interruption: And then also, that it might be glorifyed, that is, that it might so enter into the mindes and hearts of their hearers, that they might practise it in their lives, and so bring credit to the Gospell. And then indeede is <hi>Christ</hi> his throne established in mens hearts, and his scepter beares sway, among the sonnes of men.</p>
               <p>Now on the other side, <hi>The things principally</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. What is to be prayed against</note>
                  <hi>to be prayed against, are two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>The bondage of sinne,</hi> especially of <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne,</hi> which sticks so fast unto us, and is the greatest hinderer of the worke of grace in us; for the deuill, though he be a busie, and a malicious adversarie, yet he is sometimes quiet (through <hi>Gods</hi> restraining hand) and <hi>departs for a season</hi> (as <hi>Luke</hi> speaketh:) But this naturall<note place="margin">Luke 4. 13.</note>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:25845:47"/> corruption is alwayes with us, in the day and in the night: it goes to bed with us in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and hinders us of that sanctified rest that otherwise we might enioy. It riseth with us in the morning, and accompanies us in all our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</note> egging us forward unto that which is euill, and pulling us backe from that which is good, or at the least inter-mingling it selfe in our best actions, and causing them to tast of the cask from whence they proceed, and to savor of that defiled Chanell through which they flow. And therefore we should with <hi>Paul</hi> cry out against it, for though he were a regenerate man, and had beene an Instrument of conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many soules, unto <hi>God,</hi> yet he found flesh remaining in him still: so that the good that he would doe, he could not, and the evill that hee would not doe, that he did.</p>
               <p>What doth he in this case. he takes up a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable complaint, <hi>O wretched man that I am,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note>
                  <hi>Who shall deliver me from the body of this death.</hi> He calleth originall sinne <hi>a body,</hi> because it hath many wretched members, and, <hi>a body of death,</hi> because besides many other miseries, it drawes both the naturall and spirituall death upon the parties in whom it is, and here with many of <hi>Gods</hi> dearest servants are so troubled and distempered, that they many times make que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whether they be <hi>Christs</hi> subjects or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, the children of light, or the children of darknes: but this may be a comfort unto them, and a cleere testimony that they belong. unto
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:25845:47"/>
                  <hi>Christ,</hi> if with the <hi>Apostle,</hi> they <hi>grieue for it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tryall of true hatred to a corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
                  <hi>groane under it, complaine against it, and desire to be freed from it,</hi> for, as for those that are unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, when the corruption of their nature breaketh out in speeches or sinfull actions, they are merrie, jocund, and not one whit troubled thereat, but like better of themselues at such times, then <hi>Gods</hi> children doe when they are most full of grace, for, <hi>they feele their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A difference betwixt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall men.</note>
                  <hi>when they are at best, and feare future falls, when they stand in most uprightnesse,</hi> whereas carnall men are bold and venturous, and are not touched with any feare or shame of sinne at all.</p>
               <p>Let this therefore be our comfort, that though we be tempted and assaulted, and many times dangerously plunged, yet herein wee goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all unregenerate people, in that wee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour against our corruptions with might and maine, as one in a mightie River would doe to keepe his head aboue water. This is the first thing to be prayed against even the slavery of sinne.</p>
               <p>In the second place, wee are to pray against all lets and stumbling blockes, that doe hinder the proceedings of the Gospell, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the elect: we are to intreat the <hi>Lord,</hi> that he would crosse and curse all the plots and practices of <hi>Antichrist</hi> and his Adherents, and of all the limmes of the devill whatsoever, and withall, that he would in his good time, purge his Church from all idle and Idol Ministers,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:25845:48"/> and from blinde, deceitfull, and unfaithfull guides; that he would <hi>roote out every plant that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn.</note>
                  <hi>hee himselfe hath not planted,</hi> and abandon all things that doe offend, even all the remnants<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> and reliques of superstition, and such ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as doe but insnare the consciences of men, and draw a great many into persecution and trouble. And when we see the people of <hi>God</hi> to be pestered and burdened with such things, and to liue as sheepe without shepheards, we should with our <hi>Saviour</hi> haue compassion upon them, and beseech the <hi>Lord</hi> to open their eyes, that they may see what a lamentable case they are in, that so they may seeke to come out of the snares of the devill, by whom they are kept in miserable thraldome. And thus much touching the Kingdome of Grace.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the Kingdome of Glorie, that is also to be comprehended in this <hi>Petition,</hi> and therefore to be desired of us, so that from these words,</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Thy Kingdome come</head>
               <p>Thus understood ariseth this observation. That;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every child of God ought from his heart to pray</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Observat. 7.</note>
                  <hi>for the end of the world, and for consummation of the kingdome of Christ, at his last comming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is proved in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where <hi>Iohn</hi> testifieth, that <hi>the Spirit and the Bride say come.</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:25845:48"/> The spirit of regeneration, that knowes the joyes of heaven, being shed abroad in the hearts of the faithfull, stirres them up to say, <hi>come,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel. 22. 17.</note> and the <hi>Bride,</hi> that is, the Church (being inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>holy Ghost</hi>) sayes, <hi>come.</hi> It is as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for one that is betrothed to such an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent husband, as will never fall out with her, but bestow every good thing on her, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the day of mariage, as for the people of <hi>God</hi> not to long for the comming of <hi>Christ.</hi> Indeed, as the spirit sayth <hi>come,</hi> so the flesh sayth <hi>goe:</hi> If <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall might haue obtained his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, hee would by no meanes haue come into <hi>Gods</hi> presence: and so it is with fleshly men still, they cannot endure that <hi>Christ</hi> should come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in his gracious presence by his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, much lesse in his glorious presence; but it is quite contrary with the godly.</p>
               <p>Now the reasons why all loyall Subjects should desire the comming of their King, are these.</p>
               <p>First, In regard of <hi>God, who hath not the full <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> glory of his mercie and justice till then;</hi> for, <hi>in the militant Church the Devill and his members are still up in rebellion,</hi> whereby the best of <hi>Gods</hi> subjects that liue upon the earth, doe passe no day nor night without some offence or other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their soveraigne <hi>Lord:</hi> and for those whose soules are glorified in the heavens, their bodies for the most part doe lie in the dust: but at the last day all enemies shall be utterly put<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> downe and vanquished, and the elect of <hi>God</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:25845:49"/> shall be freed from all sinne, whereby <hi>God</hi> is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored, and be clothed both bodies and soules with glory and immortalitie: so that if we loue the honor of our King, wee should desire his comming. Seeing then, that his foes shall taste<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fully of his justice, and his servants of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, (both which doth make for the setting forth of his glorie) the <hi>Lords</hi> name shall be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, and the execution of judgement upon the wicked, and upon unbeleevers shall bee she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, as well as he shall be <hi>glorified in his Saints,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Thes. 1. 10.</note>
                  <hi>and be made marvellous in all them that beleeue in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>In regard of our selues wee must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> his comming:</hi> for if we doe not, wee cannot be assured of any happinesse that we shall enjoy after his comming. This is evident in <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 8.</note> where <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh thus; <hi>Henceforth is layd up for me the crowne of righteousnesse, which the Lord the righteous Iudge shall giue me at that day, and not to me only, but</hi> (to whom else?) <hi>to all them also that loue his appearing.</hi> So long as we finde not this affection in some measure in our hearts, we want an excellent argument of the certaintie of our salvation: we may be saved indeed though for the present we doe not feele this, but wee can haue no setled comfort in the consideration thereof, till in our very soules we loue the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearance of our blessed Saviour. It is the note of an harlot to say, my husband is not<note place="margin">Pro. 7. 19.</note> at home, he is gone a journey farre off, &amp;c. and so to rejoyce at her husbands absence: as for
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:25845:49"/> those that would haue comfort that they are the chast Spouse of <hi>Christ,</hi> they must with the bride say <hi>come,</hi> as was before noted.</p>
               <p>Another benefit that we shall reape by this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> unto the comming of <hi>Christ,</hi> is, <hi>that it will marvellously estrange our mindes from the world, and make us account all but drosse and dung in comparison of that blessednesse which wee shall then attaine unto:</hi> The meditation hereof caused <hi>Abraham, Isaak,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> to liue as pilgrimes<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 10.</note> and strangers upon earth, because (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle sayth) <hi>They looked for a Citie having a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, whose builder and maker is God.</hi> They had a desire of a better Countrey then the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> even of a heavenly Countrey, which caused them so little to regard the things of this life. The like may be said of <hi>Moses,</hi> who when by the eye of faith hee had seene the promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Court of Heaven, did easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne and forsake whatsoever honors and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments were to be obtained in the Court of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> He that hath a kingdome to sway in his<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 24.</note> own Country, will never be over-much enamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on some small farme, or cottage in an other.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>This earnest longing for the kingdome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of Glorie, will very much quicken and helpe us forward in the performance of our dutie both unto God and men;</hi> when we consider, <hi>That our worke</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 58.</note>
                  <hi>will not be in vaine in the Lord, but that, he that shall come will come, and will not tarrie, and his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel.</note>
                  <hi>reward is with him.</hi> This will cause us to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in all good workes, that so our crowne
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:25845:50"/> may be more glorious, and our recompence more plentifull in the day of the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>This holy desire and expectation will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> make us patiently to under goe all manner of suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of what kind soever.</hi> Which is implyed in that exhortation of the Apostle, <hi>Bee yee patient</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iames 5. 8.</note>
                  <hi>Brethren, and settle your hearts for the comming of the Lord draweth neere.</hi> Grudge not one against another, <hi>Brethren,</hi> least yee be condemned, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Iudge standeth at the doore. Paul</hi> had a very heavie burden of affliction lying upon him, enough (one would thinke) to make him sinke under it; yet he professeth, that he did not faint nor grew to be dismayed thereat: but what was it that did support him? even the expectation of that glorious estate, which he should come unto at the last. <hi>Therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>wee faint</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 14.</note>
                  <hi>not, knowing that he which hath raised up the Lord Iesus, shall raise us up also by Iesus.</hi> And againe, vers. 17. <hi>Our light afflictions which are but for a moment, causeth unto us a farre more excellent and eternall waight of glorie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing then in all these respects it appeares to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>1</label> be a dutie very needfull and necessarie for us, to pray for the Kingdome of glory; This serveth first of all, for the just reproofe of such as say this petition every day, <hi>Thy Kingdome come:</hi> But would they bee willing that <hi>Christ</hi> should come unto them?

And lastly, <hi>that no uncleane thing should enter into it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe Chap. 22. it is said to haue <hi>a pure Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of water of life, cleere as Chrystall running through it</hi> (which is an excellent commoditie in a Citie,) and <hi>in the midst of the streete thereof the tree of life, &amp;c.</hi> By all these intimating unto us, that it is a most singular and excellent place, and this is to be noted, that nothing is said of the

               <p>If it were proposed unto us, whether wee would spend our dayes on the earth where now we are, or in Paradise where <hi>Adam</hi> was? If we were in our right wits, we should make choice of heaven before Paradise, (which was a place of all manner of delights) in the earth: which is a vaile of misery, and an house of mourning, wherein all creatures doe sigh and groane in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the miseries which sinne hath brought upon them: much more then should we preferre the pallace of heaven, before our prison here upon earth; seeing that (as was before said) it doth infinitely surmount the earthly Paradise.

Here though wee haue some good friends, yet we haue withall many foes, many bad neighbours, the flesh, and the devill the worst of all: as some doe loue us, so others doe hate us, and those that loue us best,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:25845:54"/> haue their imperfections, and doe loue us but in part: and in deed we doe desire their loue but onely in part. Hence it commeth to passe, that there ariseth unkindnesses and breaches now and then betwixt the nearest friends, and most loving couples: But in heaven there shall be no such thing, but we shall loue others, and they shall loue us with a perfect and constant loue, for their shalbe in us nothing but cause of loue, grace, goodnesse, vertue and holinesse in all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</p>
               <p>All men will graunt, that it is a very desirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, to live among company that one can thorowly affect, and it is one speciall comfort that <hi>Gods</hi> children doe find in their pilgrimage: that some times they enjoy the sweet fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of such as are led by the same spirit that they are. O then how desireable a place is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where we shall haue the fruition of such blessed company, where we shall both loue, and be beloved beyond that which we can now imagine. If one should there meete with a delightfull place onely, and no company, or such as he could not like of; Heaven were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so desireable, but seeing both doe accord and meet together, it should set an edge upon our affections, and breed in us a longing desire to be there, especially sith that.<note place="margin">3 Our estate there.</note>

                  <hi>Gods</hi> dearest servants are many times scanted of possessions, and those that they haue, are but earthly, soone fading and vanishing: but in heaven they shall haue an everlasting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 4.</note>

               <p>Thus we haue in part seene what is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the kingdome of heaven, this let us often and seriously meditate upon, and bethinke our selues of the place, of the company, and of the estate that there we shall enjoy; which if we can doe, assuredly it will cause us from our very soules to say, <hi>Thy Kingdome come, Even so come Lord Iesus, come quickly.</hi> Thus much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the second Petition.

               <p>But for the better understanding of this <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> we must know that the will of <hi>God</hi> is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: One <hi>absolute,</hi> and the other <hi>secret,</hi> which we pray not for; for that ever hath beene, is, and shall be done: in which sence it is said, <hi>Who hath</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 19.</note>

               <p>Another is his <hi>revealed will,</hi> which is also<note place="margin">What is ment by Gods will.</note> double, (as after shall be shewed,) unto which we desire that obedience and submission may be yeelded; <hi>Thy will be done:</hi> but where, and by whom? <hi>in earth,</hi> that is, of the <hi>Elect</hi> which liue on earth. But what must be the manner of this obedience? <hi>as it is in heaven,</hi> that is, <hi>as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and the spirits of good and perfect men doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey in heaven:</hi> so must we desire to doe, not that we can attaine to that perfection that is in them, which is impossible, (they being now without staine or blot) but we must ayme at it, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey in that sort as they doe, as neere as we can, as in handling of these words shall be more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressed.</p>
               <p>Thus much briefly for the sense of the words. Now let us see what further instructions are there contained for our learning.</p>

               <p>Hence this observation may briefly be noted.</p>

               <p>Otherwise, if there had beene in us any abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and aptnesse therunto, why should we pray for strength to doe it? Whatsoever we are bid to aske of <hi>God,</hi> sure it is, we haue it not in and of our selues, and therefore our <hi>Saviour</hi> in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us to intreat <hi>God</hi> to bow our hearts, and to incline our affections unto his will, doth teach us, that we are utterly destitute of all naturall power whereby wee might attaine thereunto.

It is my pleasure, it is my delight, then we run headlong to all manner of evill, even as our great grandmother <hi>Eue</hi> did, when she began to yeeld to her own sense and wisdome, in judging of the eating, or not eating of the forbidden fruit, when she came so farre, the devill had as much as he desired.

                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:25845:59"/> Albeit I (say) their flesh be very backward, and untoward, so that they come unto the services<note place="margin">Comfort for a generall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease.</note> of <hi>God,</hi> as a <hi>Beare</hi> unto the stake: yet let them not be dismayed, as if their case were extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie: for this is an hereditarie disease, that all <hi>Gods</hi> elect are troubled with. Indeed when they come to heaven, to enjoy that blessed estate, before spoken of, they shall obey <hi>Gods</hi> will absolutely, and perfectly, without any mixture of naturall corruption: but while they remain upon the face of the earth, they shall find that they haue great need to make this petition <hi>Thy wil be done;</hi> That is, <hi>Lord</hi> incline my heart to obedience, and frame it in all things, to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to thy blessed will, let me not follow the wicked lusts of mine owne flesh, but the good directions of thy holy word. Let us make full account, that while we carry about us these fraile <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> we shall find in us, much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingnesse unto every thing that is good, and great aptnes and pronenes unto everything that is evill. And if (with the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi>) we can<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 8.</note> see and acknowledg, and bewaile this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our selves, and withall, striue to cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the same, let us esteeme it a great mercie of <hi>God;</hi> for no unregenerate man can goe so farre.</p>
               <p>And furthermore let us be assured, that though we haue in us many lusts and passions, yet that <hi>God,</hi> that hath enabled us, to see them and to hate them, will also enable us in the end, to subdue and overcom them. <hi>If we mortifie the

               <p>In the like sort, did the Apostle deale with his corruptions, he did his good will to worke the death of them, knowing that if he did not kill them, they would slay him; And the refore he did not as cowardly fencers, that onely <hi>beat the ayre,</hi> and dare not come nere one another: but he strucke home, and did his good will, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to destroy sinne, that so it might not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him. Whose example if we can follow though we feele much deadnesse, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse in well doing, we need not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged thereat: for if that should not haue beene in <hi>Gods</hi> children, our <hi>Saviour</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver haue bidden them make this <hi>petition.</hi> And as for those that say, they are alwaies very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling unto <hi>Gods</hi> service, to pray, to heare, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, and the like, indeed they doe not know their owne hearts.

                  <hi>it is laid open in his word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we would not be esteemed hypocrites, and rebels against the <hi>Lord</hi> of heaven, we must yeeld up our selues to be advised and guided by him, and by his testimonies. We need not stand to proue the point, the whole Scripture and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of all yeeld to it. Now the reasons to moue us hereunto are these.</p>
               <p>First, because <hi>every word of God is holy, just, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>1</label>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 12. Prov. 30. 5.</note> and pure,</hi> even as gold that is tryed in the fire. There is never a Commandement of <hi>God</hi> but it is holy: never a promise but it is faithfull: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a threatning but it is true. And therefore we haue reason to yeeld to them, rather then to the unholy, unjust lawes of sinne and Sathan.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>In regard of our owne good: If wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> heare his word and keepe it we shall be blessed:</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in our bodies, blessed in our goods, blessed in our names, blessed in our seede, and in a word every way blessed, both at home, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.

                     </gap>.</note> our understandings, and in our memories, in our hearts, and in our practices, <hi>we shall bee loved of the Father:</hi> Not, but that hee loved us, even when we were his enemies, yea from eternitie: But then, he will manifest his loue unto us, and we shall finde by evident experience and by sound effects in our soules, that he doth carrie a fatherly affection towards us.</p>
               <p>And further, it is added in that place by our <hi>Saviour, And I will loue him:</hi> but how will he manifest this loue? <hi>I will shew my selfe unto him</hi> (saith he) to wit, in his holy word, and in his blessed Sacraments, &amp;c.

               <p>Many other are the benefits of obeying <hi>Gods</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:25845:61"/> sacred will, which we may read of <hi>Psalme</hi> 119. and in sundry other places of Scripture, which for brevitie sake I doe purposely passe over, that we may come unto the use of the point: Which maketh;</p>

               <p>First, <hi>In regard of the Lord, that layeth his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> hand upon us, we ought with all humilitie to subject our selues,</hi> for he is a just <hi>God</hi> and doth us no wrong at all: a wise <hi>God,</hi> and seeth what crosses are fittest for us: a mercifull <hi>God,</hi> that will not suffer us to be pressed downe too low, but <hi>in judgement will remember mercie:</hi> and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Hosea.</note> a mighty <hi>God,</hi> that can lay upon us as heavie burdens as he pleaseth: and therefore the longer we stand out with him, the worse is it likely to goe with us: for when he sets in with us, he will never leaue us till he hath either broken our hearts or broken our backes. And therefore when men come to this, that they cannot put up Sathans injurie or indignitie, that they will not undergoe such a crosse and such a miserie, then they take the right way to cause the <hi>Lord</hi> to heape more afflictions upon them, till they be either converted or confounded.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore in all kindes of distresses la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour<note place="margin">A necessarie resolution for Christians.

                  <note place="margin">Ierem.</note>
                  <hi>and I will beare it,</hi> yea, albeit our crosse bee very grievous and extraordinary, yet must we submit our wills unto <hi>Gods</hi> hand, even as our Saviour did, when hee was to indure a most shamefull and painefull death, <hi>Not my will, but</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.</note>
                  <hi>Lord, let him doe what seemeth him good.</hi> And lastly, good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> hearing that his seed should be carried away captiue, and all that he had be translated unto <hi>Babell,</hi> he frames his heart unto patience with this meditation, <hi>The</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King. That it is a great sinne not to joyne our will to Gods will.</note>
                  <hi>word of the Lord is good.</hi> When <hi>God</hi> thought it best, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> thought it best likewise.</p>
               <p>And it is a shamefull thing, and a fearefull sin, for any one to thinke otherwise, and for a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:25845:63"/> to imagine his will to bee better then his Creators; as every man doth that shewes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe discontented at that which it pleaseth the <hi>Lord</hi> to inflict upon him. And thus much touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first reason taken from <hi>God</hi> himselfe.</p>
               <p>A second motiue to induce us to patience, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>2</label> may be taken <hi>from the afflictions which doe lie upon us,</hi> and that in divers respects, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, because <hi>If we be the elect of God we shall</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 They are in measure. Isa. 27. 8.</note>
                  <hi>be corrected in measure and in moderation,</hi> not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the desert of our sinnes, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the proportion of our strength. The <hi>Lord</hi> will deale with us in that case, as wise earthly Parents use to doe with their children, who will not lay so waightie a burthen upon those that are young and weake, as on those that are of riper yeares and of greater strength.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note>
                  <hi>God is faithfull and will not suffer us to bee temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aboue that we are able,</hi> but will giue his<note place="margin">Psal. 86.</note> strength unto his servants, that we may be able to beare all whatsoever he imposeth upon us. And therefore we need not to be dismayed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der afflictions, seeing that we haue so sure a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to be supported therein, and that the <hi>Lord</hi> will not inflict so much on us as our iniquities deserue, but as our need requires and as our strength can beare.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>our sufferings here, are but momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 They are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie. 2 Cor. 7. 14.</note> and therefore we should quietly submit our selves under them, as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> did under his. Indeed, we do many times thinke them to bee very long; but what is the reason
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:25845:64"/> thereof: because we consider of them in a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall manner, not loking (as <hi>Paul</hi> did) <hi>on the things that are not seene,</hi> but <hi>on the things which</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 18.</note>
                  <hi>are seene</hi> for if we did compare our temporary affliction with the eternall joyes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, they would seeme to be of no continuance in comparison thereof.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we should patiently beare those<note place="margin">3. They are for our good.</note> corrections, that the <hi>Lord</hi> inflicteth upon us <hi>In regard of the benefit of them, viz.</hi> that they tend greatly to our profit, <hi>that our iniquitie may</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 10.</note>
                  <hi>be thorowly purged, and that our holines may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased.</hi> Thus we see in regard of the <hi>nature</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isaiah 27. 9.</note>
                  <hi>quality,</hi> and <hi>profitablenesse</hi> of the crosses, that <hi>God</hi> exerciseth his children withall, that there is great reason that they should say, <hi>Thy will be</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. In regard our sufferings are under our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servings.</note>
                  <hi>done.</hi> Lastly, <hi>In regard of our selves there is just cause, that we should meekly and quietly, submit under his hand:</hi> because when we thinke our case to be most distressed, we suffer nothing so much as we haue deserved, or as many others of <hi>Gods</hi> deere servants haue endured, who haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> yet done nothing so much hurt and mischeefe by their sinnes as we haue. And in truth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son<note place="margin">A true reason of much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der crosses.</note> why many are so impatient under crosses, is this, that they haue not their full load as yet laid on them: that they haue had so much affliction, as hath wakened their pride, but not so much as hath mastered the same: for if they were paid home, in any proportion, as they do deserue, they would be tame enough (through <hi>Gods</hi> grace) and lay their hands upon their
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:25845:64"/> mouthes, <hi>as Iob did,</hi> judging those afflictions<note place="margin">Iob.</note> that now they undergoe, to be matters of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and acknowledging with the people of <hi>God,</hi> that, <hi>It is his mercie that they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lam. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>as in regard of our deserts, so in regard</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of our need, we should be patient in all manner of afflictions, for having so corrupt a nature as we haue, what should we doe unlesse we had some meanes to curbe us? we are naturally like wild asses coltes, (as it is said in <hi>Iob,</hi>) altogether<note place="margin">Iob 11.</note> untractable, unteachable and unseruiceable, till the <hi>Lord</hi> haue broken our hearts, and taken downe the pride and stubbornesse of our flesh, and framed us unto some dutifulnesse, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And even after this is done, if we du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looke into our hearts, shall we not find that we stand in great need of continuall taming? If one disdain us, or scoffe and jest at us, shall we not quickly find a great deale of pride boyling within us? shall wee not requite like for like, taunt for taunt, scoffe for scoffe? if it be thus with us, assuredly wee need all the corrections that lie upon us: and when we feele this swelling about our hearts, it is high time that a veine should be opened, that our corrupt bloud shoud be let out.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that there is such great cause why <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>1</label> we should submit ourselues to <hi>Gods</hi> will, in all manner of tribulations; This serveth for the just reproofe of such as are very unquiet under their crosses, and make far greater adoe about
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:25845:65"/> their afflictions, then about the sinne that bring their afflictions, whereas the readiest way to be freed from miseries, either alreadie lying upon<note place="margin">The way to be rid of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</note> them or likely to come upon them, were this. First of all, <hi>to purge their hearts, and their hands from all manner of iniquities by sound and hearty repentance, and then to prepare and arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with patience to take up their crosse,</hi> and with contentednesse to beare the same so long as it pleaseth <hi>God</hi> to continue it upon them. Not but men may use lawfull and good meanes for the preventing and avoyding of needlesse and unnecessarie dangers, or for the removing of such evils as haue already befallen them: but the meaning is, that they should not vexe and fret when they perceiue by good effect that it is the will of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that they should be thus or thus exercised and tryed.</p>
               <p>A worthy example hereof wee haue in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> commanded him to sacrifice his owne Sonne for a burnt offering, to kill him, to cut him in peeces, to pull out his entralls (for<note place="margin">Levit. 1. 6.</note> this was the manner of the burnt offering) to burne all upon the Altar: and this he was to doe with his owne hands, unto him that was not his sonne alone, but his onely sonne, his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and beloved sonne; the sonne of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, for whom hee had so long waited and prayed: yea, that sonne of whom <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> should come: so that in killing him he might seeme not onely unnaturall, but monstrously wicked, in that thereby he should depriue not
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:25845:65"/> himselfe alone, but all the elect of eternall sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Yet notwithstanding, as soone as ever he knew that it was <hi>Gods</hi> will that he should doe it, <hi>hee consulted not with flesh and bloud,</hi> but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently set upon the performance of it: <hi>Rose up</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 2.</note>
                  <hi>earely in the morning,</hi> made every thing readie that might serue for such a businesse, went unto the place which the <hi>Lord</hi> appointed, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting wife, or servants, or any body else with his purpose, least they should haue gone about to hinder him: and when he was come unto the place, <hi>He built an Altar, couched the wood, bound Isaak his sonne, layd him on the Altar upon the wood, and stretched out his hand, and tooke the knife to haue killed him.</hi> Doubtlesse it went very neere his heart, not to see onely, but to be also the death of his owne Sonne: Yet, he quietly submitted himselfe unto his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as knowing that he should get nothing by wrangling with <hi>God,</hi> which willing and readie submission of his the <hi>Lord</hi> did so accept, that he sweares by himselfe that hee would greatly blesse him, and <hi>exceedingly multiplie his seed &amp;c. And that therein all the Nations of the earth should be blessed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like we may obserue in <hi>David</hi> when that <hi>Absolon</hi> rebelled against him, and with-drew most of his subjects from him, and caused him to flee for his life. He never chaffed at the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as many a one would haue done, nor useth any termes arguing discontentment, such as these; <hi>Who was ever so wronged, who ever so abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:25845:66"/> as I? What, to be deposed from my throne, and driven from my kingdome by mine owne Sonne, by</hi> Absolon, <hi>whom I from a child so dearely respected whom having deserved to die, I freely pardoned, and greatly favoured?</hi> This is a most intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble injurie, and such an indignitie as I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver indure, &amp;c. We heare no such words from <hi>David,</hi> but rather contrarie, <hi>If the Lord say</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam.</note>
                  <hi>thus, I haue no delight in thee, behold here I am, let him doe as seemeth good in his eyes:</hi> and if he will not restore me the Kingdome againe, <hi>His will bee done,</hi> I am well contentto part with it. So should we conclude for all manner of cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and in particular for the pestilence, where with our Townes are now visited; If it bee the <hi>Lords</hi> will that I shall fall by that stroake, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be his name.</hi> Though it be not an ordinarie doore, yet a doore it is through which many of the Saints haue gone to their rest, and through which I hope to come unto the like: If it be the <hi>Lords</hi> good pleasure to call me that way: which chearefull resolution if we can attaine, Then;</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>here is matter of singular consolation <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>2</label> for vs,</hi> in that God hath given vs an answer to this petition, which wee haue often made: <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> for it is not a matter of nature, or of wit, to be able to submit vnto Gods will, but indeede a worke of supernaturall, and speciall grace of the Holy Ghost, vouchsafed only vnto the elect.</p>
               <p>And indeed this argueth that there is much heavenly wisedome in vs, according to that of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:25845:66"/> the Apostle <hi>Iames,</hi> where exhorting men to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, (hee saith) <hi>If any want wisedome, let</hi>

                  <hi>him aske it, &amp;c.</hi> implying thereby, that when we grow impatient in any distresse, it is not by reason of the greatnesse or multitude of our crosses, but by reason of our want of spirituall wisedome: for if we could consider (as was shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before) whence, and why our afflictions come, and what effects they shall haue in us, we should be able to undergoe any miseries, and be well content as dutifull children, to be who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the disposing of our most loving and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull father.</p>

               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:25845:67"/>
               <p>First, Because they are perfect patterns, and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> without any exception, as for the best men that are, they may offend, and doe offend as well as we: and therefore are no sure coppies for us to follow.</p>
               <p>And besides; this must needs be a speciall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> meanes to humble us, when we see how farre short we come of that holinesse which is in them.</p>
               <p>And it may be also a continuall spur unto us, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to help us forward unto perfection, so that we shall alwayes be at the growing hand, whereas if we imitate any mens example, we shall faile, both of humilitie, and of growth in grace, for within a while we shall either indeed (or in our conceit at least) be as good as those whom wee propose as patterns to be followed. And then we shall swell with Pride, and beginne to be high minded, and so not striue unto perfection but either stand at a stay, or goe backward.</p>
               <p>Now, that we may the better discerne, how<note place="margin">How the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels doe obey the will of God.</note> the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> are to bee imitated, wee must consider more particularly, how they doe obey, <hi>viz.</hi> willingly, faithfully, and humbly.<note place="margin">1. Willingly. Isa. 6. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, they obey <hi>readily,</hi> and <hi>faithfully,</hi> and <hi>humbly.</hi> In which regard, the <hi>Angels</hi> are said to haue winges, to note their swiftnesse, in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming whatsoever is injoyned them, they find such joy and contentment in <hi>Gods</hi> will, that they doe with much delight undertake and goe through with whatsoever service he calleth them unto, and such as is the obedience of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:25845:67"/>
                  <hi>Angels,</hi> as also that of the <hi>Saintes,</hi> for they are as free from all impediments and hindrances, and as full of all grace, and goodnesse, as the <hi>Angels</hi> themselues. Herein therefore let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be like unto them, even to be joyfull, and chearfull in the service of <hi>God,</hi> not as many who will not come unto prayer, or hearing of the word, or the like, but they must be haled, and drawne thereunto by a kind of violence: but as for their lusts, and the pursuite of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and vanities, there they are winged, and very nimble and forward.</p>
               <p>Let us be otherwise minded, and casting a way whatsoever clogs may hinder us, let us chearfully runne the race of christianitie, that is set before us, till we be crowned with happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and immortalitie in the heavens.</p>
               <p>Secondly as the <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>God</hi> obey <hi>readily,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Faithfully.</note> so doe they also obey <hi>faithfully,</hi> not in some things at some times, but in all things at all times; If the <hi>Lord</hi> giue them never so many commandements: they care as much for the performance of all of them, as of any one of them. When the <hi>Angell</hi> was sent to inflict the pestilence on <hi>Iudea,</hi> he did not smite one or two<note place="margin">2 Chron.</note> villages and then desist: he did not pretend that it was against his nature, to proceed any further, no, that had been enough to haue made him a devill in hell.</p>
               <p>And shall any man then, who is but a worme prescribe unto <hi>God</hi> what he shall command him, and refuse in somethings, to yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:25845:68"/> unto his holy will, because it is against his nature, nay, his nature must stoop unto <hi>Gods</hi> law otherwise it will bring him to destruction in the end. <hi>None are such grosse sinners, but they will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare one sinne or other; and none almost are so sanctified, but they would faine be borne with, in one sinne or other.</hi> Come to some that haue beene iniurious to their bretheren, and tell them that they must be reconciled, they wil be content with that, but tell them withall that they must make restitution, and there they will leaue you; Oh, they cannot like of that, but why should they not like as well of one commandement of <hi>God</hi> as of another: Is it not their duty to yeeld obedience unto all? certainly if they endeuour not so to doe, they are not like the <hi>Angels</hi> in heaven, neither doe they make this petition from a heart altogether sincere and faithfull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, and lastly, <hi>they yeeld obedience in humilitie, casting downe their crownes before the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel. 4.</note>
                  <hi>Lords footstoole:</hi> And being well content, that he shall haue all the glory, to whom alone it doth appertaine, how much more should wee that are but dust and ashes, abase our selues, and humble our hearts in his presence, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of him are al things, and that therefore, all praise belongeth unto his maiestie.</p>
               <p>Here then are those to be reproved, that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>1</label> though they take most lewd and wretched courses, yet imagine to carry out all their foule sinnes with this, that others are as bad or worse
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:25845:68"/> then they are. What need such a stirre (say they) I hope I doe but as my neighbours doe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands are as great offenders as I? Like enough so: but haue you learned the <hi>Lords</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er no better? Haue you babbled over this petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Thy will bee done in earth, as it is in heaven,</hi> so often, and not understood it? Or if you did understand it, and know that <hi>God</hi> requireth that we should obey him, <hi>as the Saints and Angels doe,</hi> haue you so little regard of his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that you will rather follow the crooked rule of wicked mens example, then the perfect di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which the examples of the <hi>Saints &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> do giue to you? This sheweth that we are far from sincere obedience, and therfore we should learne be times to take better wayes, least being altogether unlike the Saints of <hi>God</hi> here, we be utterly excluded from their company hereafter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This may serue for the humbling of <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>2</label> the best that are,</hi> seeing that when they haue done what they can, yet they come farre short of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall obedience. The proud <hi>Pharisie</hi> thought himselfe in very good case, when hee was not like the <hi>Publican:</hi> but who bad him to make comparison with the <hi>Publican?</hi> He should haue compared his obedience with that that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in heaven, &amp; then he should haue found himselfe more like a devill in hell, than an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel or Saint in heaven: and surely the most god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that are if they examine their actions by this touch-stone, shall see great cause to cry out with the <hi>Publican, Lord be mercifull to me a sinner.</hi>

               <p>This, <hi>David</hi> (though a King, and such a one as came by that hee had as lawfully as any man in the world) confesseth of him and his people when they had beene so liberall, <hi>Who am I &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 14.</note> It was a great matter that they had abilitie to offer so largely, and to doe it willingly, in that he saith, <hi>Who am I? and who is my people, that we should be able to offer willingly?</hi> That was a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefit, yet he saith, <hi>All things come of thee, &amp;c.</hi> They had given great gifts, yet they had but payd <hi>God</hi> his owne, nay, but a little part of his owne; and therefore he saith, <hi>O Lord all this abundance is from thee, &amp;c.</hi> And hee dwells on this, that <hi>though God had put them into possession, yet he had not put himselfe out of possession.</hi> Yea, might some say, we received it from him at the first indeed, but now hee hath lost his title to them.

               <p>But, <hi>We need not aske divers things which wee <label type="milestone">

               <p>So that the first reason that they are his, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of his right.</p>
               <p>And secondly, that though we had them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in our hands, yet if <hi>God</hi> doe not maintaine and continue them unto us, they can doe us no good.

                  <hi>much, but bring in little: yee eate, but haue not enough: yee drinke, but are not filled with drinke: yee cloath you, but there is no warmth: and hee that earneth wages, earneth wages to put in a bagge with holes.</hi> And therefore men had need come unto <hi>God</hi> be they never so wealthy, because else their wealth will be but poison unto them, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a meanes to hurt them than to doe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good,</p>
               <p>For <hi>Instruction,</hi> that therefore before we lay <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>1</label> hand of any of the creatures, we pray unto <hi>God</hi> that he would bestow them on us, and sanctifie them unto us; for every creature is sanctified by<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.</note> the word and prayer. So that we must pray that <hi>God</hi> that giues us the creatures, would sanctifie them unto us, and us unto them, and then wee
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:25845:71"/> must be thankfull, which we shall be if we pray fervently for them, and that not onely in word but in deed, which we shew, when we use them to that end and purpose that <hi>God</hi> hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Contrary to this is the practice of those, that if they haue apparel and food enough, they pray not for them, or if they doe, it is so cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as who should say, this they haue alreadie, and therefore doe not with fervencie craue a blessing upon them from the hand of <hi>God.</hi> But such men mocke <hi>God</hi> when they say this petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thinke whether <hi>God</hi> giue it, or giue it not, wee care not, if <hi>God</hi> will not, our barnes and store-houses will.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this serues to reproue those, which <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse. </seg>2</label> abuse their wealth to excesse and riot, and pride &amp;c. Who, howsoever in word they come unto <hi>God,</hi> yet they doe not in deed: for as far as any one is proud, so farre he trusts not on <hi>God,</hi> but would thrust him out of possession; and if they thought they were appointed to bee <hi>Gods</hi> ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and that all they haue came by his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and that to the end they might serue him, in them, and by them, they would be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to use them accordingly, as <hi>God</hi> hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but the great abuse of them to surfet and riot, this doth proue, that howsoever they say they haue these things of <hi>God,</hi> yet they come by their owne labour, by their wit and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie.</p>
               <p>For <hi>singular comfort to Gods children,</hi> If all be <label type="milestone">

But how is he provided for but by prayer, and calling on the name of <hi>God?</hi> Yea, but he hath wealth and friends which hee leanes upon. Hath he so? yea, cursed is he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he with-draweth his heart from <hi>God,</hi> and resteth on the arme of flesh, we must first waite on <hi>God,</hi> and pray unto <hi>God,</hi> and then assure our hearts he will not faile us: And though others haue more, yet let us not envie them: shall our eye be evill, because <hi>Gods</hi> eye is good? let him doe what he will with his owne, neither let us murmure nor repine, because others haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plentie then we: for, <hi>what is that but to thinke the world beares some sway in the matter, and that God is put out of possession?</hi> But we must know, as <hi>promotion, so riches come neither from the East nor from the West, but from God alone.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this should pacifie our hearts, if wee pray unto him and depend upon him, according to our faith it shall be unto us.</p>
               <p>In that he bids us pray, <hi>Giue us,</hi> not <hi>giue mee &amp;c.</hi> we may obserue:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That wee should bee carefull of our brothers estate</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Observa. 13</note>
                  <hi>as well as of our owne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that every faithfull man must pray for all faithfull men, because we are members one of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:25845:72"/> another, and all members of <hi>Christ:</hi> therefore we must be carefull for them as for our selues. For in the naturall bodie, we will not be content <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                  </label> to haue one arme clothed, and the other naked, or to haue both clothed, if the legge be naked: nor will not rest satisfied, till all bee provided for: so we being the members of <hi>Christ,</hi> should pray that others should be provided for as well<note place="margin">Psal. 28. 9.</note> as our selues; that all <hi>Gods</hi> people who are his inheritance be prayed for. This we see by the practice of <hi>Iob,</hi> who was carefull of others need as of his owne: insomuch, that he was <hi>a Father</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 29. 16.</note>
                  <hi>to the poore and fatherlesse, and as an husband to the widow, &amp;c.</hi> and did not spend that which <hi>God</hi> gaue him in excesse and riot.</p>
               <p>To reproue those, who if their bellies bee <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>1</label> full, and their backes cloathed, they care not whether others sinke or swimme: how can they lift their hands unto <hi>God,</hi> or take this prayer in their mouth, who though they can helpe others yet goe not about it? they say but in hypocrisie <hi>Giue us this day our daily bread.</hi> For the meaning of <hi>Christ</hi> in this petition is, to stirre up mens hearts that they may giue to those that haue need; now when they haue abilitie and will not giue, what doe they but dissemble? They must doe this with the hand, as well as pray it with the mouth, else they doe but take <hi>Gods</hi> name in vaine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>for singular comfort to all poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <label type="milestone">

                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:25845:72"/> Saints doe not onely craue of <hi>God</hi> the things of eternall life for them, but also all things conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for this life: now <hi>God</hi> will heare their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers when they pray in faith, and will deny them no good thing. And therefore let them make this account, in their doubts and in their feares, (for then is their tryall how they stand upon <hi>Gods</hi> promises) when they haue no comfort, let them remember that all the Church doth pray for them, and then what if their necessitie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and their familie increase, the <hi>Lord</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to maintaine a great family, as well as a small family.

Let us labour therefore to beleeue that all worldly things are not the worlds gifts, but <hi>Gods</hi> gifts, and that he is sollicited day and night, when we are a-sleepe, and our familie is at rest, that then perchance, many thousand Christians are solliciting our case unto <hi>God,</hi> that he would send us reliefe. If we could beleeue this, it would quiet our hearts, and we should be provided for and our state maintained.</p>
               <p>It followeth, <hi>Giue us this day our daily bread. [This day</hi>] That is for the present time to serue our turne, and that, that should content us, as our little children they depend and trust upon

And so <hi>God</hi> would haue us deale, not to aske for many ages, but for the present day. Whence we obserue;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Christians must be content though they haue</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Its <hi>needlesse,</hi> because <hi>our heavenly Father knowes</hi>

                  <hi>that we haue need of all these things,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will supply us in the best time.

                  </label> power and is able, and mercifull and willing to helpe us, and is full of wisedome, and therefore will not suffer us to bee pinched aboue our strength. Therefore our owne children shall rise up in judgement against us, when they see that we know their wants, and they haue tasted of our kindnesse heretofore, we see how chearefull and comfortable they are, yet we are earthly, and <hi>God</hi> is an heavenly father, that hath dealt mercifully with us many times nay, with dogs and swine, he clotheth the grasse, and feedeth the beastes of the field, the <hi>young Ravens, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math.</note> And why then should wee not come unto him, and rest upon him?

               <p>Secondly, <hi>It is bootelesse:</hi> and therefore hee<note place="margin">2. Bootlesse.</note> saith, <hi>Care not for the morrow:</hi> wee should not care for to morrow, or for this time twelue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneth, and he addes the reason: for, <hi>who by</hi>

And as it is for stature, so it is for state also; what condition <hi>God</hi> hath assigned unto us that we shall haue, when wee haue done all our working, carking and caring.</p>
               <p>This serues againe exceedingly for <hi>reproofe <label type="milestone">

               <p>Therefore if we haue nothing before hand, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but liue all our life as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did, that at
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:25845:74"/> evening we can make an even reckoning with all the world, and haue nothing left but <hi>Gods</hi> promise: yet we should be thankfull, for haue we not cause to be thankefull, when we haue as much as we pray for, and that we haue: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>God</hi> doth try his children with want of apparell and of food, not but that he can giue<note place="margin">One cause of sharpe tryalls.</note> it them, but that he may see what use they will make of his promises, what faith they haue in<note place="margin">Exod.</note> their hearts, as he did the <hi>Israelites</hi> to see how they would remember their late deliverance? They thought they had beene full of faith, but when they wanted water, they shewed that they were full of unbeliefe and of murmuring, and therefore they fell out with <hi>Moses:</hi> but he that will pray in faith must say, <hi>Lord</hi> giue so much as is needfull for the day, which <hi>God</hi> will never with-hold: hee that hath given us his sonne, could giue us all the wealth under heaven, but we must be content, if we haue things needfull for the day, and if he giue us any thing before hand, labour to bee more thankefull, and not wholy to rest upon it.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Our:</hi>] Here should seeme to be a contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that wee should begge it: yet it being <hi>our</hi>

                  <hi>owne,</hi> its <hi>Gods</hi> gift, and yet <hi>Our:</hi> but the reason why it is termed <hi>Our:</hi> is,</p>
               <p>Because, <hi>Every beleever is in Christ Iesus, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. 2 Cor. 6.</note>
                  <hi>having interest in him, all is ours, 1 Cor. 3. Though wee haue nothing, yet wee possesse all things,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we possesse <hi>Christ:</hi> and therefore its cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Our:</hi> for howsoever we lost our right by our

               <p>Secondly, because <hi>wee come by them by such a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> meanes as God hath ordained, viz.</hi> by labour and diligence in our calling, which is <hi>Gods</hi> decree,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>
                  <hi>Thou shalt eate thy bread in the sweate of thy face.</hi> Though <hi>Adam</hi> were reconciled unto <hi>God,</hi> yet he must labour and travell, and if he did so, then he might eate his owne bread comfortably: So he exhorts in another place men to <hi>labour and to eate their owne bread.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> saith in this<note place="margin">2 Thes. 3.</note> case, <hi>Blessed shalt thou bee when thou eatest the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of thy hands:</hi> because then wee walke as<note place="margin">Psal. 128.</note>
                  <hi>God</hi> bids us. And therefore we doe as children: who when their parents bid them doe such and such a thing, to the utmost of their strength, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> and then promise them somewhat for their paines: when they haue done it, they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably and boldly craue that as their owne.</p>

If men should haue as much wealth as they would, it would make them proud, and if they should haue so little as their enemies would, it would make them fret and murmure: so that we should pray for so much as is fit for our charge, and as that doth increase, that <hi>God</hi> would enlarge our maintenance.</p>

               <p>We pray that <hi>God would giue us a blessed use of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that which we haue:</hi> for the softest bed cannot giue us sleepe, nor the finest food fill our hearts with joy and gladnesse without <hi>Gods</hi> blessing, but we may eate with much bitternesse and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment: a man may labour and heape up riches, and yet leaue them to others. <hi>If a man</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>1</label> beares men in hand, that they can fulfill the whole law: and that they are without sinne, nay that they can goe beyond the law, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue somewhat for others likewise. Surely then they need not this prayer, nor to be beholding
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:25845:78"/> to <hi>God.</hi> As likewise to overthrow the practice of the frailer sort, (as they terme them) that goe unto the Priest to forgiue them, and pray unto Angels and Saints: when as <hi>Christ</hi> teacheth us, to goe directly to our heavenly Father for<note place="margin">Exod. 34.</note> remission, it being his Name, and his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant onely to forgiue sinne.</p>
               <p>Then also, <hi>It serues against corrupt nature,</hi> that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>2</label> whereas we stand in greatest need of <hi>remission of sinnes,</hi> yet when we want meate, and drinke, &amp;c. we can be earnest for them, but are not halfe so eager for the <hi>remission of our sinnes,</hi> whereas we should <hi>hunger and thirst after righteousnesse,</hi> that is the pardon of our sinnes, and <hi>Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse;</hi> this indeed shewes that a number doe not beleeue that they stand so much in need of remission of sinnes.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Instruction;</hi> that <hi>therefore wee should more <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>3</label> desire the pardon of our sinnes, then any other bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,</hi> because its better to want bread for our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, then <hi>Christs</hi> righteousnesse for our soules; to want meat, the which we may doe without any great hurt, then to want remission of our sinnes, which hardens the heart, and procures many judgements. We may as boldly come for that as for our daily bread; and therefore the <hi>Lord</hi> hath put the petition for <hi>daily bread</hi> before this, because men will say, they hope <hi>God</hi> will giue them food and rayment, &amp;c. because hee promised it. Why so, he hath promised remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinnes likewise, and doth offer it as willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and giue it as easily, as our daily bread.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:25845:78"/> Therefore if wee come unto <hi>God,</hi> wee should make <hi>God</hi> a lyer, if we thinke hee will not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our sinnes, as well as giue us our daily bread: nay rather too, because he hath made us more promises for that: and its certaine, <hi>Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath his meate and drinke in mercie, he hath remission of his sinnes likewise.</hi> Otherwise if they be out of <hi>Gods</hi> favour, let men fare as well as they can, the curse of <hi>God</hi> shall be upon their meate: he will vexe their soules, and pursue them by his plagues, that they shall haue no comfort in their meate. Therefore this should strengthen our consolation, that howsoever our sinnes haue beene horrible, yet upon our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance we may aske forgiuenes of them, as bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we may aske <hi>our daily bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in that we are taught by our Saviour to take in others with our selues, saying, <hi>Forgiue us, &amp;c.</hi> hence also we may obserue;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is not enough, when we aske remission of our sinnes, to craue it onely for our selues, but wee must aske it for others also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh, <hi>Confesse your sinnes one to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iames 5.</note>
                  <hi>another, and pray one for another.</hi> So <hi>Samuel</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 12.</note> counted it an horrible sinne against <hi>God, to cease to pray for the people,</hi> and durst not cease praying for them. So <hi>Moses,</hi> when the people had cast off <hi>God</hi> and him also, and worshipped Idols, he<note place="margin">Exod.</note> was not content to speake unto them onely by rebukes, but spake unto <hi>God</hi> for pardon for their

So <hi>Stephen,</hi> when they were readie to dash out his braines, yet he sought not revenge, but that little time he had, he spent it in prayer for them: for in truth they had done him no hurt, but drew him from mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to happinesse: so though the <hi>Iewes</hi> did perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute <hi>Paul</hi> miserably, yet he was content for their sakes to be cast out as an alien, so they might be saved.</p>
               <p>To reproue those that are content to see and <label type="milestone">

Much more are they here to be reproved, that are glad in their hearts to see men fall into sinne, that are so sold unto the devill, and receiue pay from him: that as he can never heare more joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full newes, then that a professor is falne into some sinne, (nay, if it be but a false and slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous report, hee will greatly rejoyce at it) so will they likewise: oh they are farre from saying this petition from an upright heart, nay, they rather wish, oh, that men might fall into sinne,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:25845:79"/> and that which they wish to others, might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall themselues: as they stand affected, so they prosper.</p>
               <p>It is for comfort to the members of <hi>Christ,</hi> in <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>2</label> that not they alone, doe pray for the remission of their sinnes, but even all the elect doe recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their cause to <hi>God,</hi> that he would pardon their sinnes, and giue them the righteousnesse of <hi>Christ,</hi> which should cheare our hearts when we feele deadnesse and faintnes in our prayers: namely, that <hi>Christ</hi> hath commanded all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to pray for us.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Our debts] our sinnes;</hi> which are called <hi>debts</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Why our sins are called debts.</note> the more to terrifie us, for that is in our nature, to loath to be in debt: and men will say, oh! if I were out of debt I were well; it troubleth much to be in that case, that a man cannot goe up and downe the Towne, but he must looke over his shoulder, fearing least some one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should haue him by the back to arrest him: now the debt of sinne is farre more dangerous; So that hence we obserue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That sinne is the most miserable debt in all the world. <label type="milestone">

                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, because other debts make us liable to <label type="milestone">

               <p>Secondly, other debts when the debters are dead, doe not hurt him, but the debt of sinne lies heavier then, than before; as soone as the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:25845:80"/> soule departs from the bodie it goes to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of hell, and the bodie followes soone after to be tormented together with it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, other debts, though they bee great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> may be recovered, &amp; the creditor be recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but this debt all men and Angels and all the creatures in the world, are not able to keepe us out of it. No man can satisfie for our sinne but onely the bloud of <hi>Christ:</hi> and therefore if men doe so feare those <hi>arrerages,</hi> which their friends and themselues may helpe them out of: oh, then how should they feare that woefull debt, which none can satisfie but the bloud of <hi>Christ:</hi> which if it be not discharged that way, makes them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to eternall damnation!</p>
               <p>Againe, for other debts, a man may goe out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of the Countrey beyond Sea, and so escape his creditor: but for this debt, whither can we goe? if to the Sea <hi>God</hi> can drowne us, if to any place<note place="margin">Psal.</note> on the earth, he can cause the earth and hell it selfe to open their mouthes to swallow us.</p>
               <p>Lastly, now and then we may meete with our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> creditor, when he hath no processe nor writ for us; but wheresoever <hi>God</hi> meetes us, he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse for us, and a prison for us also: therefore this is the greatest debt, and the cause of all other debts.</p>
               <p>To reproue those that are loth to forfeite a <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse. </seg>1</label> bond, and to runne into debt more then they are worth; what say they? debt it is a trouble and toyle of all other: oh! there are a number that haue worse debts, whereby they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:25845:80"/> every day to be cast into hell, and yet they care not. It were a strange matter if a number of writs and attachments should come out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <label type="milestone">

                  </label> a man to lay hold of him, that by and by he must bee committed to prison, if hee then should fall to sporting and gaming, we would thinke him more fit for his fransie to be carried to Bedlam, then for debt to be cast into prison. Yet here are many writs gone out from <hi>God</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst wicked persons, for taking his name in vaine, for receiving the Sacrament unworthily, &amp;c. and for breach of all the tenne Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, those tenne bonds, and yet they eate and drinke, as if debt to <hi>God</hi> were no debt.

               <p>Wee heard before what we were to aske in the former Petition, namely that <hi>God</hi> would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue us our sinnes, and impute unto us the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> Now in the next Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, <hi>we pray for sanctification,</hi> wherein we are taught.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>What to pray against,</hi> viz. <hi>That God would not lead us into temptation:</hi> that he would not suffer us to be overcome by sinne and Sathan, nor punish our inward corruptions by giving us to fall into grosse crimes, but either keepe us from temptation, or giue us victorie in tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>To pray for the meanes whereby wee may be kept from falling into temptation,</hi> viz. <hi>the Lord would deliver us from the evill of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and preserue us so, that sinne and Sathan may not haue dominion over us.</p>

                  <hi>but deliver us from evill.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FIrst for the <hi>Coherence,</hi> in that our Saviour having taught us to pray for <hi>remission of sinnes,</hi> now teacheth us to pray for <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:25845:84"/> and for grace and vertue to bee kept from the power of sinne and Sathan. The point is. That,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not enough to haue pardon of sinne past, but <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Observat. </seg>
                     </label> wee must pray for power and grace to resist sinne and Sathan in time to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For else we shall be as bad as ever we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Therefore <hi>David</hi> when he was as sure that his sinne was forgiven, as that <hi>God</hi> was true; yet that would not satisfie him, but he laments his originall sinne and his rebellion, and prayes for <hi>a new heart, and a right spirit, and that God would</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note>
                  <hi>stablish him with his free spirit;</hi> that hee might not be under the bondage of sinne: so that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving apprehended the remission of his sinnes, he labours to be delivered from the corruptions of his heart, that he might not fall into the like mischeife againe. <hi>For in truth there can bee no comfort in the remission of sinnes, as long as strong passions and unrulie lusts doe remaine: And, where sinne and lust is strong, faith and hope are feeble:</hi> therefore if we would beleeue the remission of our sinnes, and haue joy in the same, wee must pray for preservation against sinne, as well as for<note place="margin">An incourage<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment to studie for sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due sinne.</note> remission of sinne. And hereunto we should be stirred up, yea the rather, because when wee haue remission of our sinnes, then the Devill hath the greatest quarrell against us: before that when we carry the Devils image, he can accord with us very well; but when we are converted,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:25845:85"/> and carrie the image of <hi>God,</hi> (which the Devill<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> doth hate) then he knowes us to be such as will tread on his head; and therefore he is the more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> violent against us with horrible temptations, to overthrow us. And then likewise our flesh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to stirre more, to bee more unrulie and strong, and to shew what it is when <hi>God</hi> begins to worke.</p>
               <p>And therefore this should teach us to joyne these two Petitions together, and to bee instant with the <hi>Lord</hi> to purge our nature, as well as to take away the guilt of our sinnes: for, <hi>to desire pardon for that which is past with teares and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, is but to make God an earthly Father,</hi> as our children will say, <hi>forgiue me and I will doe so no more:</hi> and yet in truth, if <hi>God</hi> giue them not grace, they will doe so againe, for wee cannot amend our nature, but we must come unto the <hi>Lord</hi> for pardon for that which is past, and for grace against the time to come: for el<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>sanctification,</hi> as for <hi>justification, God</hi> would as well helpe them against the corruption of their nature, as against the guilt of their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

               <p>It is for <hi>consolation unto Gods Children,</hi> that <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>And lead us not &amp;c. Christ</hi> would haue us to use those termes, and not as some doe, <hi>Let us not be led, &amp;c.</hi> but [<hi>lead us not</hi>] or carry us not, &amp;c. Whence obserue. That,</p>

               </p>
               <p>And therefore we need not say, permit us not to be led, but <hi>lead us not,</hi> for except <hi>God</hi> doe lead us, the devill cannot, for he is chained, that<note place="margin">Iude. 6.</note> though the devill might seeme to be able to doe great matters, yet <hi>God</hi> doth reserue him in chaines.</p>
               <p>Oh! <hi>But is not the devill full of windings and <label type="milestone">

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:25845:86"/> the great day, when he shall be payd home in full measure: the sentence of the Iudge is past, and he is kept in prison till the day of execution, and no Iudge hath a prisoner so safe, as <hi>God</hi> hath the devill chained by the hooke of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: so that what can he doe, but that which <hi>God</hi> appoints him? So we see, there were a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion<note place="margin">Mark. 5. 12.</note> of devils in a poore man, which <hi>Christ</hi> cast out, who be sought him, that <hi>he would send them into the heard of swine, &amp;c.</hi> Though they were but swine, and the swine of wicked men, that could not abide <hi>Christ,</hi> yet a whole Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of devils could not touch one swine, till <hi>Christ</hi> sent them. If <hi>Christ</hi> should haue said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, if you haue any power in your selues goe; they could not haue gone, and therefore they pray <hi>Christ</hi> to send them, and if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not touch one swine, much lesse any servant of <hi>God,</hi> man or woman whosoever.

                  <hi>cast some of them into prison for tenne dayes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Devill dealt with them, <hi>God</hi> set him downe what he should doe, and how long he should afflict them, not so little time as they would, nor so long time as hee would afflict them; and then he shewes what should bee the effect of the temptation, namely, <hi>that they might be tryed and refined:</hi> the Devils end was, that they might be discouraged, but <hi>Gods</hi> end, that they might be polished and reformed, so <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. it is said, <hi>when the Devill had finished<note place="margin">Luk. 4.</note> all his temptation, he departed from Christ;</hi> if hee
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:25845:87"/> should haue gone as farre as he would, he would haue tempted him all his life, for hee is never wearie of doing mischiefe, and hee is of such impudencie, that he is never ashamed and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its said, <hi>when he had finished all his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c.</hi> that is, when hee had done his taske that <hi>God</hi> had appointed him, when he had gone through with his message, he had no more to say, and then he departed: so when he sets up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any, the <hi>Lord</hi> appoints how long, and how much he shall tempt them, and when he hath done his worke, to giue over.</p>
               <p>This is first, <hi>for consolation unto Gods Children <label type="milestone">

                  </label> should haue no hurt; and if a malefactor could not touch the child, further then his father would appoint him, surely the child should be in little danger. So all <hi>Christians</hi> are <hi>Gods</hi> sheepe, bought with the bloud of his sonne, and we are <hi>Gods</hi> children, and he loues us, even as he loues <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe: and we shall be led into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,<note place="margin">Iohn 17.</note> no further then our Father and our shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard will, therefore it cannot goe amisse with us.</p>

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:25845:88"/> walke in feare and trembling, but in a fleshly boldnesse, after which the next neives is, that our inward sinnes are punished with outward sinnes: that was the beginning of all <hi>Davids</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal.</note> trouble, <hi>when in his prosperitie he said hee should never he cast downe:</hi> why? because his moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine was so strong; if he had said because <hi>God</hi> is strong, then he might haue stood, but he staid upon fleshly reason, because he had many men and good store of money, and strong walles &amp;c. Therefore he thought he should never be cast downe, but so soone as he came to pride and boasting, he was cast downe, <hi>God</hi> turned away his face, and withdrew his grace, and set <hi>Bathsheba</hi> before him: and then he fell to adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, murther, and cloaking of his sinne, and that at length wakened him. So <hi>Peter, Christ</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> foretold him, that he was weake and would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him, he thought himselfe strong enough: if all the world should forsake <hi>Christ,</hi> he will fight for him, and sticke to him, and never forsake him. If he had said, <hi>Lord</hi> thou hast seene more in me then I see in my selfe, indeed it is in my nature to deny thee, strengthen me that I may not, &amp;c. then he had beene safe, but standing on his owne strength, he quickly denies <hi>Christ,</hi> sweares and curses, and falls into many evils, but after the resurrection, <hi>Christ</hi> comes unto him, and askes him, <hi>Peter lovest thou mee more then these?</hi> as though he should say, <hi>Peter</hi> you made<note place="margin">Iohn. 21.</note> your bragges that you had more loue to me, then all the world besides, what say you now,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:25845:89"/> doe you loue me more then these? Oh no, hee would not boast of his valor any more, but he sayes meekely, <hi>Lord thou knowest that I loue thee,</hi> he had left his comparison now: if a man should haue asked <hi>Peter</hi> before he had fallen, you say you will never forsake your master, where I pray you haue you this strength? from your selfe, or from <hi>Christ,</hi> he would not haue said from <hi>Christ,</hi> because he prayed not for it, and <hi>Christ</hi> told him, that it was not in him; but hee thought it to be in his owne nature, that he had had more valor and worthinesse in him, then a thousand of them. But when men come to this bragging and boasting, then the next newes, and the best newes for them is, that they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some grosse sinne to waken them: as we see in <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                  </label> a Lethargie, which is a kind of falling sicknesse, that brings men into a great slumber, the best way that Physitions can take, is to giue them receipts that may cast them into a pestilent bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fever, because their sences are benummed and dead, to waken them, and dry up the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that benumme and besot them: so it is with <hi>Gods</hi> children, when they grow carelesle <hi>God</hi> casts them into a burning fever, and lets Sathan and their owne corruptions loose; that so they may fall into some grosse sinne, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into shame and sorrow, into anguish and feare, that every body may rebuke them, which is their best medicine, as it was for <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter:</hi> but if we would loue the word of <hi>God</hi> unfainedly, and walke in humilitie and feare,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:25845:89"/> and not trust on riches, nor strength, nor any earthly thing, those would be the best preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues to keepe us from temptation.</p>
               <p>But here may arise a question, <hi>how this can <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>
                     </label> goe currant, that God should lead us into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iames 1.</note> since its said, <hi>that God tempteth no man,</hi> and a reason is added, <hi>because he himselfe cannot be tempted?</hi> one wicked man tempts another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he himselfe is tempted first. The adulterer corrupts a woman, because he himselfe is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted first, and so the devill being naught him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he would haue no body good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tempted our first parents.</p>
               <p>Therefore its said, that <hi>God can tempt no man,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                  </label> because he himselfe is not tempted: the meaning<note place="margin">How God is said to lead us into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> whereof is, that <hi>God soliciteth no man to evill,</hi> nor puts ill into any mans nature, he being the fountaine of all goodnesse, yet he may be said, to lead into temptation.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>by with-drawing his grace and holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> when we waxe proud, and will not be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p>And then, <hi>by setting occasions before us, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> are very forcible to draw us to evill, when Gods grace is taken from us.</hi> As we see in <hi>David,</hi> when the baite was layd before him, he was quickly gone: and so <hi>Peter</hi> he would fight, and doe such wonders at first, &amp;c. but <hi>God</hi> sets him in such a place, where a poore silly maid might examine him, and presently he faintly denies his Master, lyes and sweares, and had no valor in the world. For, <hi>when occasions are offered, all the strength of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:25845:90"/> the flesh consumes as waxe before the fire.</hi> If a man would say, I haue a bodie that the fire will not heate, the best way to convince sinne, is to put a coale to sinne: So <hi>Achan</hi> confesseth that he saw a little wedge of gold, and two <hi>Babylonish</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iosh.</note> garments, that he coveted them and tooke them when no body was by: hee saw the coast was cleere, there was a good bootie, and there was enough for the Tabernacle beside; the <hi>Lord</hi> did not put this into him, but this occasion discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                  </label> what was in him: that occasion made not <hi>Achan</hi> naught, no more then the fruit makes the tree naught, but that manifested what he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By letting Sathan and their owne corruption <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> loose:</hi> as its not much, that when the sheepe will <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                  </label> not be guided by the shepheard, they should be exposed to the woolfe. So when originall sinne is let loose, the devill sets it forward, and yet neither is this against mens wills, but they runne violently into sinne, and good it may be for them in conclusion: for since they haue not been thankefull, that <hi>God</hi> hath heretofore restrained the rage of Sathan and sinne, so that all the fault is in our selues, for having opportunitie, they sinne willingly and readily.</p>
               <p>Then the end is good. First, in the wicked,<note place="margin">Why God leads the wick<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note>
                  <hi>to discover their hypocrisie, and that God may haue the more glory thereby. Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Achitophel</hi> had they not beene discovered, they should haue beene reputed as good men as any in the world. <hi>David</hi> had not a friend which hee could trust more then <hi>Achitopel,</hi> what my familiar friend

               <p>Secondly, <hi>in the godly,</hi> when they are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure<note place="margin">The end why God leads the godly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to temptatiō.</note> and proud, <hi>to humble them, waken them, and to make them sit surer all their life after,</hi> as it did <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter; David</hi> would bragge no more neither would <hi>Peter</hi> boast of his loue, but (saith he) <hi>Lord thou knowest that I loue thee,</hi> truely and unfainedly, though weakly.

               <p>For <hi>Iesus Christ, Paul,</hi> and others were temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whereof <hi>God</hi> giues two reasons why <hi>Paul</hi> was tempted; First, to worke humilitie in him,<note place="margin">1. 2 Cor. 12. 2.</note> and to keepe him from pride.

It is Sathans drift, when we are in danger to driue us to fall to shifting and lying, that is it which he would haue. If one had come to <hi>Peter,</hi> and told him, if he be one of <hi>Christs</hi> Disciples, he must suffer with him, and <hi>Peter</hi> had said, <hi>the will of the Lord be done,</hi> then he had beene deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from evill, but when he denyed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, then he rushed into the evill of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It is for comfort,</hi> that we be not <label type="milestone">

                  <note place="margin">Iames 1.</note>
                  <hi>divers temptations, because they try our faith,</hi> and worke patience; they make us to haue a strong, and pure, and sound faith, and abundance of patience, therefore, though we may not pray not to be tempted, yet we may pray, not to be hurt by temptation: And then, <hi>the more bitter our temptation is, the sweeter and stronger our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation shall bee, for when the flesh is most abased by temptations, then men are raised up to most comfort in Christ Iesus, and to such peace as passeth all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi> Sinne is the greatest evill, under which all other evils may bee comprehended, this once removed, the loving countenance of <hi>God</hi> shineth full of mercie and consolation: and plentie of all rich mercies expedient for us doe follow; Therefore we are taught to pray here, <hi>Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evill.</hi>

               <p>First, <hi>An acknowledgment of Gods All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie, (thine is the Kingdome, the power, and glorie:</hi>) All which is set out by the perpetuitie thereof, <hi>for ever:</hi> which words shall be more fully interpreted in the handling of them seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>A confession of the certaintie of faith,</hi> for the obtaining of the things asked, which is implyed in the word <hi>Amen:</hi> which is as much as to say, <hi>So it is, I haue intreated such things of the Lord, as concerne his glorie and my good, and now I rest confident for the obtaining of them at his hands.</hi> Thus much briefly for the order of the words.</p>
               <p>First, In that our Saviour doth annexe this
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:25845:93"/> reason in the conclusion of this Prayer, <hi>for thine is the Kingdome,</hi> that is, thou hast soveraigne authoritie over all; <hi>the power,</hi> that is, as thou hast right to rule, so thou hast withall sufficient abilitie to manage thy Kingdome: <hi>and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that is, <hi>and seeing the praise and honor of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is done belongs wholy unto thee:</hi> &amp; therfore (for so much is implyed) graunt us our requests.

               </p>
               <p>The Scriptures abound with examples for the<note place="margin">Gen. 32.</note> confirmation of this point. <hi>Iacob,</hi> when he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for protection and deliverance from his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Moses,</hi> when he made suite for the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</hi>

               <p>Now, the end why we should deale thus, is <label type="milestone">

               <p>The use of which might haue beene, <hi>for the <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>And furthermore, <hi>It might instruct the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <label type="milestone">

               <p>We must not onely seeke unto him for that which we need, but render unto him that which he deserues. And indeed, of the two, better it were that wee should want his helpe, then that he should bee deprived of his glory. To this purpose, is that exhortation of the Apostle. <hi>Let

               <p>First, therefore, let this be a motiue unto us, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> to offer unto the <hi>Lord</hi> continuall praises, <hi>because this is both the most excellent, and most acceptable</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Isay 6.</note>
                  <hi>service that wee can performe.</hi> The <hi>excllencie</hi> thereof, doth appeare in this, that the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:25845:94"/> of <hi>God,</hi> and the soules of just and perfect men in heaven, are continually exercised herein and therefore by the performance thereof wee shall be made most like unto them. Then for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the <hi>acceptablenesse of it,</hi> let us hearken what the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe saith, <hi>he that offereth praise glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 50. 23.</note>
                  <hi>me,</hi> a man may offer requests unto the <hi>Lord</hi> and not honour him, but serue himselfe, in seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to haue his necessities supplyed: but he that offereth the sacrifice of praise must needs glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>God,</hi> because that proceedeth from a free and loving heart, which is touched with a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sence and feeling of <hi>Gods</hi> loving kindnes and mercifull goodnes. All the tenne lepers pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto <hi>Christ</hi> to be healed, but only the poore <hi>Samaritan</hi> glorified <hi>God,</hi> because hee alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to giue thankes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it stands us upon, evermore to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> magnifie the Name of the <hi>Lord, because we haue alwayes cause of thanksgiving.</hi> For even, in the midst of our crosses, wee enjoy innumerable blessings, corporall, and spirituall, the <hi>Lord in</hi>

               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:25845:95"/>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thanksgiving is a singular meanes <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>3</label> to keepe us from discouragement:</hi> if a man doe only take a view of his infirmities, hee cannot but be much dismaid, and will at length thinke that <hi>God</hi> cares not for him. But if he doe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, take notice, of the <hi>Lords</hi> loving kindnesse in every thing and praise him for the same, that cannot but worke in him, an assurance of his favour, and consequently much ioy of heart, and chearfulnesse of spirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>the practice hereof will marvellously <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>4</label> fit us for prayer, in</hi> which regard they are so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ioyned together, as <hi>Col. 4. 2.

                  </note> hath not acknowledged the mercy of his <hi>God,</hi> will bee very dull and heavie in his petitions, and glad to make an end before he hath begun.</p>
               <p>Is it so that thanksgiving is a speciall part of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>1</label> prayer? Then hence are they to be condemned, as carnall persons, whose prayers doe consist altogether of petitions. But as for praises, they either medle not at all there-with, or at least but very slightly: under which condemnation doe the Papists come, as by their prayer-bookes may evidently appeare. <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>small unto us?</hi> Is it not worth thankes that wee are of the number of those that are <hi>elected,</hi> that are <hi>called,</hi> that are <hi>justified,</hi> that are <hi>sanctified,</hi> and shall within a while be crowned, and that, <hi>with an eternall crowne of Glorie?</hi> Oh! unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full creatures we, if wee be not affected with these things, and if we be not ashamed that ever there entred into our hearts so much as one thought of discontentment, against our bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and gracious, and most mercifull Father. <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Let this be an Instruction unto us,</hi> that we be as fervent and frequent in offering unto
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:25845:96"/>
                  <hi>God</hi> due praises, as in making for our selues need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full requests. But how may I attaine unto this,<note place="margin">How to attain unto a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full neart.</note> may some say?</p>
               <p>First, we must get assurance of the pardon of<note place="margin">1. To get par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sinne.</note> all our sinnes: for no man can joyfully thanke <hi>God</hi> for any thing till then; for, <hi>certaintie of the remission of our offences, is the very ground of true and heartie thankesgiving:</hi> and therefore when the Prophet <hi>David</hi> stirreth up his soule to praise the <hi>Lord</hi> for all his benefits, he placeth this in the fore-front, <hi>Which forgiveth all thine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 103 3.</note> that therefore must be laboured for in the first place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Whosoever would haue a thankefull</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. To get an humble heart.</note>
                  <hi>heart, must get an humble heart:</hi> and then when a man sees that he is worthy of nothing, he will be thankefull for every thing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he that would be able to praise <hi>God</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. Often medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on all sorts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</note> with a joyfull heart and chearefull lippes, <hi>must often and earnestly meditate on his promises, both for temporall and spirituall good things:</hi> in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation whereof, we must labour to haue our hearts so affected, <hi>that wee may rejoyce in the Lord because of his word,</hi> as the Prophet did, that<note place="margin">Psal. 56.

How much more then (if we had the eyes of our mindes truely enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) should we see cause of rejoycing in the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all promises of the King of heaven, whose words are all <hi>pure words, who is not as man, that</hi>

                  <hi>he should lie, or as the sonnes of men, that he should</hi>

               <p>And as we must often exercise our thoughts<note place="margin">4. To meditate on mercies past, present, and to come.</note> upon the promises of <hi>God,</hi> so must we also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>mercies past, present,</hi> and <hi>to come,</hi> we must consider what great favour and loue hee hath borne towards us before we were borne, againe since we were borne, especially since we were borne againe. Neither must we stay here, but must raise our hearts aboue the earth, and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously ponder upon that blessed estate, which we shall at length come unto: when we haue put off the image of the <hi>first Adam,</hi> and haue put on the image of the <hi>second Adam;</hi> when wee shall lay downe these our earthly Tabernacles, that wee may be made like unto the Sonne of <hi>God</hi> in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which being duely thought of, will so affect our hearts with joy, that though we should liue in all manner of miseries, and that from the day of our birth, unto the houre of our death,

                  <hi>is the Kingdome O Lord, and thou excellest as head over all.</hi> And the like doth <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> after that <hi>Daniel</hi> had told him his dreame and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation thereof, <hi>Your God</hi> (saith he) <hi>is the God of Gods, and the Lord of Kings:</hi> and it stands with good reason that the absolute soveraigntie ouer all the Potentates on the earth should bee ascribed unto him.</p>
               <p>First, because <hi>he is the author of their being,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>1</label> and of the being of their subjects, as also of all the meanes whereby they and their Kingdomes are upheld and maintained; For, <hi>he made of one bloud all mankind to dwell on the face of the earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 26. 25.</note>
                  <hi>and in him they liue and moue and haue their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> and as he bestowed life upon them, so doth
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:25845:97"/> he still owe unto them breath, and all things whereby life must be continued. No earthly Monarch can giue a being unto any one of his subjects, nor keepe the breath in his nostrels when the <hi>Lord</hi> calleth for it: nay it is not the most mighty and puissant Prince in the world, that can (by his onely command) make one haire white that was before blacke, or blacke that was before white, the most that they can doe, is to performe the office of nursing Fathers to bring up such as are committed to their charge: as for life and breath, meanes and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and such like, they are all the proper and peculiar gifts of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, as he is the author of all these, <hi>so <label type="milestone">

               <p>Thirdly, he is the disposer of all things that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>3</label> are intended or effected by them: <hi>Their hearts</hi>

               <p>Secondly, is <hi>God</hi> the King of Kings? then if wee meane to bee great men indeede, and to ascend unto the highest promotion, <hi>Let us preferre his service before any other;</hi> For heere the common proverb holdeth most true; <hi>There is no service to the service of this King:</hi> for hee knoweth all his servants by name, and taketh speciall notice of every one of them, and of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good service that they performe (be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so secret and hidden from the eyes of men) and hee doth no sooner see it, but hee is ready to reward them in due season: neither will hee bestow upon them those promotions only, nor chiefly, which concerne their bodies, but those especially, that concerne their soules. And that not onely in this life, but principally in that which is to come. Neither shall one of his subjects forestall another, but though many hundred thousands haue sped exceeding well before us, wee shall fare never the worse, but according to our workes shall our reward be: nay, there is not the meanest of his subjects, but he shall be made a King, yea a farre better King then any worldly Potentat that is a meere naturall man, that ever hath beene, is, or shall bee, to the end of the world; For the poorest Christian that is, doth raigne and beare rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the flesh, the world and the divell in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent life, and is heire apparant unto the crowne

Would we then faine get true honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion? oh, then let us seeke his favour and his face evermore, who is the <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords,</hi> and can make us in all respects truly honourable both in his owne sight and in the eyes of men and Angels.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, sith <hi>God</hi> is the absolute Governor <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>3</label> of all the whole world, and all other Princes are but his substitutes; If we would haue good things effected by any that are in authoritie, let us beseech the <hi>Lord,</hi> to perswade and incline the hearts of his officers thereunto, to stirre them up to the performance of those services, which may make most for the glory of his Name, and for the comfort and benefit of his afflicted people, and then if such Magistrats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto the <hi>Lord,</hi> he will with draw them from evill, and incline them unto good by his holy Spirit: If they be not his, he will doe it by his providence, for their comfort and refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing that call upon him, and waite for his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; sithence all Authoritie is in Gods <label type="milestone">

               <p>Herein doth the <hi>Lord</hi> differ from earthly Kings: who haue sometimes authoritie, but want power, so that they cannot bring their subjects to doe that which they would haue them, as the case stood with <hi>David:</hi> but <hi>God</hi> as he hath all authoritie in his hand, so hath he all power likewise.

               </p>
               <p>Whatsoever strength is found in any creature in heaven or in earth, it is derived from him, and limited by him, in this respect it is said by the<note place="margin">Psal. 62. 11.</note> Prophet <hi>David, That power belongeth unto God. Angels</hi> are called <hi>Powers,</hi> but all the power that they haue, they received from the <hi>Lord,</hi> and must use it not for themselues, but for him, and for the performance of those workes which he enjoyneth them: so in another place the same Prophet magnifieth the Name of <hi>God,</hi> saying<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29.</note>
                  <hi>Thine O Lord is greatnesse and power, &amp;c.</hi> This will evidently appeare if we consider these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>

                  <hi>as if they want the outward meanes of helpe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, are presently dismayed, and conclude with themselues, that in this case the world must needes goe very hard with them.</hi> Herein they marvei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously dishonour the <hi>Lord,</hi> in that they doe not giue unto him the praise of his power.

               <p>Here also are those to be condemned, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> when the times are hard, and worldly powers are against them, beginne to be out of heart, as if there were no comfort any longer to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.

What if all the Potentates in the earth should oppose themselues against us? are we any whit the lesse safe? no surely, for all that might which they haue is ordered by the <hi>Lord,</hi> and although wicked men will doe us what mischiefe they can, yet can they not doe what they would: though their malice be great, yet their power is none at all.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is that the <hi>Lord</hi> saith unto his people, <hi>I, even I am he that comfort you, who art thou that thou shouldest feare a mortall man, and the</hi>

Here then is this immoderate feare of men to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, especially, when it causeth men to faile of their duty, either wholy or in part, that dare not be so forward in Religion as they would be, for feare of the displeasure of such and such great ones: that is a grievous sinne, and it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them in whom it raigneth, to be rancked in the very fore-front of that hellish rabble men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Revelation</hi> 21. 8. where the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> speaketh thus; <hi>The fearefull and unbeleevers, and abominable, and murtherers, and whoremongers. shall haue their part in the Lake that burnes with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as they are to be blamed, that are to much afraid of men, so are they also that are too feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:25845:102"/> of Sathan, for though he be a power, and principalitie, yet is he limited, and restrained by the <hi>Lords</hi> hand, and is as it were a strong ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Iude 6.</note> in a mightie chaine, so that he can goe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>God</hi> will permit him. Hee could not touch <hi>Iob,</hi> nor any thing of his, untill he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived<note place="margin">Iob 1.</note> his commission from heaven: nay, hee could not enter into the heard of swine, untill<note place="margin">Math.</note>
                  <hi>Christ</hi> had granted him libertie so to doe: And therefore there is no cause why <hi>Gods</hi> children should bee immoderately afraid of him. And thus much of the uses of reproofe.</p>
               <p>In the second place, <hi>this maketh for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">

               <p>Againe, this should teach us, not to despaire of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> any one though his case bee very hard, for <hi>God</hi> is almightie, and the things that are impossible unto men are very easie unto him.

               <p>This is the effect of both the former, for if the <hi>Lord</hi> be the onely Soveraigne King, and hath dominion overall, if he haue all power in himselfe, and no creature any at all, further then it is derived from him, and limitted by him: then in all equitie and right, all glory must be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto him.

               <p>One is <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36. where it is said, <hi>For of <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>1</label> him, and thorow him, and for him are all things, to him bee glory for ever:</hi> The sence of which place is, that he made all creatures, they are of him; Then againe, hee upholds all the whole world, and all things consists through him, no creature helpes him to keepe the world in repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: but as he created all, so he sustaines and maintaines all things being created.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile: </seg>
                  </label>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:25845:104"/> the same, and so they haue the praise of the reparation, the builder onely of the making thereof: but it is otherwise in this goodly buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the world: for, <hi>as the Lord made all by his powerfull word, so he upholds all by his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hand.</hi> And, <hi>the reason why he useth Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and Ministers, and other officers under him is not because hee needes them, but because hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to doe them good in imploying them in his service.</hi> And that good which they doe, they doe it by his strength, not by their owne. In which regard, all the glory remaineth still due unto him: and therefore the Apostle in the place last alleadged, doth conclude thus, <hi>Of him, and through him are all things,</hi> (and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all) <hi>for him,</hi> that is, <hi>for his honour,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee inferreth, <hi>to him bee glorie for ever, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A second reason is, because <hi>there is in God the <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>yea goodnesse it selfe, &amp;c.</hi> and whatsoever goodnesse or holinesse is in men, or Angels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from him: therefore in regard of the infinite excellencie of his nature, all glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto him.</p>
               <p>Which serveth, first, <hi>for the reproofe of such <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>1</label> as are proud of any priveledge or gift, that they are endued with all:</hi> they doe not beleeue that all power, dominion, and excellencie is of <hi>God,</hi> and that therefore all glory pertaineth unto him.

Which was <hi>Herods</hi> mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">Act. 12.</note> when he heard a companie of fooles to flatter and extoll him, as if he had spoken like a <hi>God,</hi> and not like a man; he was content to take their commendation: but if hee had had the grace to consider, that though he were more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent then his neighbours, it was not from himselfe, but from the <hi>Lord:</hi> then would not he haue set up himselfe aboue <hi>God</hi> in pride, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue <hi>God</hi> in glory; and so might he haue esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the fearefull judgement that fell upon him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>For Instruction,</hi> that wee should <label type="milestone">

Whatsoever yee doe, doe all to the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is for the comfort of all <hi>Gods</hi> servants, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>3</label> doth all glorie belong unto <hi>God,</hi> then surely the godliest men shall haue most honor, for <hi>God</hi> will honour them that honour him. Indeed, if wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, or devils had the disposing of glory, then sinners should carrie it away, but seeing that none haue interest therein, but they on whom the <hi>Lord</hi> bestoweth it, assuredly, they that are the godliest men, shall be the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest men, and that even in this life: for the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:

               <p>The meaning hereof is, that whatsoever in the words before is attributed unto <hi>God,</hi> doth alwayes belong unto him, his <hi>Kingdome</hi> is an <hi>everlasting Kingdome, Dan.</hi> 3. 33.

               <p>
                  <hi>All things in God are <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Observat. </seg>
                     </label> eternall.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:25845:106"/>
               <p> This is proved, <hi>Deut. 33. 27. The eternall God is thy refuge from aboue, and underneath are the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting armes, &amp;c.</hi> Whence it is plaine, that <hi>God</hi> is eternall in himselfe, and an eternall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of his Church: either hee will cast out their enemies himselfe, or else (as it is in the same place) <hi>he will say, destroy them.</hi> That is; will giue them strength to doe it, for this very bidding of them is enough. More particularly, his mercie is everlasting, so saith the Prophet,<note place="margin">Isa. 54. 8.</note>
                  <hi>For a moment in mine anger I hide my face from thee, for a little season, but with everlasting mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie haue I had compassion on thee, sayth the Lord thy Redeemer.</hi> The like may be said of his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he hath chosen us before the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, which election is a fruit of his<note place="margin">Ephe. 1. 9.

And this must needes he;</p>
               <p>Because, <hi>the Attributes of God be not qualities <label type="milestone">

When we loue, wee<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4. 8.</note> loue with a quallitie, but <hi>God</hi> loues with his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore it is sayd, that <hi>God is Loue.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, his rewards are everlasting, both to the wicked and godly. For to the wicked it shall be said, <hi>Goe from mee yee cursed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting fire, &amp;c.</hi> If then <hi>God</hi> doe alwayes punish
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:25845:106"/> reprobates, and shew the fruites of his Power, and Iustice, and Truth eternally; It must needs necessarily follow, that his Power, Iustice, and Truth are eternall. The like may be said of the riches of his mercie towards his Elect, who shall at the last day enjoy <hi>an inheritance immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pet. 1. 4.</note>

                  <hi>them in the heavens,</hi> which is else-where termed <hi>eternall life.</hi> Which serveth,</p>
               <p>First, For the confutation, of that foolish o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>1</label> of wicked persons, that imagine, though they haue sped ill in their sinfull practices here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, yet they shall haue better successe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. As for instance, some haue beene bitter and violent against Christians, and haue gone by the worst, yet doe they hope to haue a day against them at last, if not at one time, yet at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. But let such know that <hi>Gods</hi> power, and justice, against them, and his loue and kindnes towards his servants, are alwayes the same; And hee hath said, <hi>That they that hate Sion shall perish.</hi> So it is for his glory, to bring downe all wicked enemies, to take the craftie in their craftinesse, and to cause them to fall into the same pit, which they haue digged for others. Therefore haue they no cause to looke for a better day, but rather for a worse, even for the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his fierie wrath against them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most.</p>
               <p>Others there are, <hi>that will filch and steale <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>2</label> doe deale falsly, and injurously with those that put them in trust, and being taken with the manner;</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:25845:107"/> they are not much troubled, nor discouraged from their lewd courses: but goe on still in hope, that they shall speed better then others; but how can they thinke so? Oh, they haue learned more wit now, they will carry their matters more closely and secretly, and keepe their plots from being discovered: but is not <hi>God</hi> eternall: doth not he see their sinne as much as before? And is not hee as able to bring them to shame and punishment, as hee did before? yes certainly, and therfore they that haue sped so ill heretofore, may looke to speed worse hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Because they haue made no better use of <hi>Gods</hi> former punishments.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Here is an horrible terror for wicked <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>2</label> men?</hi> Is <hi>God</hi> eternall in his <hi>justice,</hi> and in the effects therof, oh! then, where shall they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that are sinfull, and ungodly: and that<note place="margin">1 Pet.</note> liue and die in their wicked courses, neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing them nor truly repenting for them? They shall come before such a Iudge as liues for ever, to <hi>power out the vialls of his wrath upon them and to torment, them in fire and brimstone for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore.</hi> As his loue, is everlasting towards those that feare him: so is his displeasure against those, that provoke him, and his indignation being kindled, will be like a <hi>river of Brimstone,</hi> which shall burne for ever, through the breath of his nostrels.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, is it so, that <hi>God</hi> is eternall in his <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse. </seg>3</label> loue; <hi>then here is matter of singular consolation</hi> for the Elect of <hi>God:</hi> for nothing shall hinder their
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:25845:107"/> salvation, seeing that the <hi>Lord</hi> loveth them with an unchangeable loue, it is said of our loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, that <hi>much water cannot quench it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 8. 7.</note>
                  <hi>can the floods drowne it.</hi> What shall wee thinke then of his loue towards us, can anything quench that? No, saith the Apostle. <hi>I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that neither death, nor life, Angels, nor</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 38.</note>
                  <hi>Principalities, nor Powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the loue of God which is in Christ Iesus our Lord.</hi> Neither is this a comfort onely in regard of eternall life, but also in regard of the troubles of this life, that, <hi>God is the same; Yesterday, and to day, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note>
                  <hi>for ever.</hi> The same when wee are without the meanes, as when we haue them: the same in <hi>Warre,</hi> as in <hi>Peace.</hi> In <hi>Sicknesse</hi> as in <hi>Health,</hi> in <hi>Want</hi> as in <hi>wealth.</hi> And then shall wee taste most plentifully of the rivers of his kindnesse, when afflictions ly upon us in the greatest measure. Let us be sure that wee bee his servants now, and we shall ever be comforted, perfected, and deliuered. For if <hi>God</hi> should cease to loue his Elect, hee should cease to be himselfe. Now breefly to speake of the last word;</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Amen.</head>
               <p>Which is as much, as So it is. Where wee obserue. That;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When wee haue prayed, and cast our burden up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord, we must make reckoning that we shall <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Observa. </seg>
                     </label> be heard.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:25845:108"/>
               <p>And therfore must say unto our soules, <hi>it is so,</hi> or <hi>it shall be so</hi> I shall obtaine what I haue asked, so farre as <hi>God</hi> sees good for me. So saith the Apostle <hi>Iohn; This is the assurance that wee</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 14.</note>
                  <hi>haue in him, that if wee aske any thing according to his wil, he heareth us, &amp; if we know that he heareth us, whatsoever wee aske, wee know that we haue the petitions that we haue desired of him.</hi> This perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion must be setled in us, if we be <hi>Gods</hi> children, and that whatsoever wee aske in faith, <hi>God</hi> will grant it; And if we doe not beleeue, so much we doe dishonour the <hi>Lord.</hi> Our Saviour also pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth this point, whatsoever yee desire when yee<note place="margin">Mark. 11. 24.</note> pray beleeue that you shall haue it, and it shall be<note place="margin">Iames 1. 5.</note> done unto you; So also <hi>Iames</hi> biddeth us, <hi>Aske in faith, and not waver, for such a one shall receiue nothing of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is good reason for this: for if wee haue <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>1</label> not a warrant to aske how dare wee be so bold, as to come into the chamber of presence to put up our suites? If wee haue a warrant, it is vile wickednesse for us, to doubt of obtaining, for that is to call the truth of <hi>God</hi> in question. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>1</label>
               </p>
               <p>Heere then, are such to be reproued, as goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from prayer as uncertaine as they came to it.</p>
               <p>And secondly, <hi>Here are we to be instructed, not <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>2</label> onely to beginne our prayers earnestly, but also to end them confidently,</hi> giving <hi>God</hi> the glorie of his Power, Truth, Mercie, and assuring our selues that we shall obtaine whatsoever in faith we haue asked, in that manner, and measure, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:25845:108"/> time, which <hi>God</hi> seeth most fit for us. Thus when <hi>Hannah</hi> had put up her suite, she rested<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.</note> confidently upon the <hi>Lord</hi> for the granting of it, and so obtained according to her hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. And so shall wee, if wee depend upon his gracious promises, for the pardoning of our sinnes, the healing of our natures, the supply of our wants, both inward and outward; <hi>the Lord</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 3.</note>
                  <hi>will giue us aboue that which we can aske or thinke.</hi> And whatsoever is wanting in corporall things, shall be supplyed in spirituall, and the longer we waite knocking at the gate of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, the more plentifully shall wee bee recompenced in the end, when hee comes to fulfill all our desires.</p>
